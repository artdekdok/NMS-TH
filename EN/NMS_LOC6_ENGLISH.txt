Datestamp <STELLAR><AUDIO>TXT_RadioNoise<>%DATE2%<> :: I still have such quotas to be met, ah! The worries! Korvax-Friend is only wasted time and expense compared with these! Their strange food, their fussy insistences, such a drain!
Datestamp <STELLAR><AUDIO>TXT_RadioNoise<>%DATE3%<> :: We dined together in my quarters again last night. I prefer Korvax-Friend more and more. They are unlike other Korvax. They have such interesting things to tell me...
Datestamp <STELLAR><AUDIO>TXT_RadioNoise<>%DATE4%<> :: Machine-Friend is correct. We must be free of our flesh to reach our potential. Metal and light, holy metal and holy light! It will free me, free all Gek!}
TRA_CAPT_LOG_LANG_2	{Datestamp <STELLAR><AUDIO>TXT_RadioNoise<>%DATE1%<> :: I gave a speech to the crew before we left. Ah, you should have seen them as they were back then, Brave-Gek all! 
We were going to re-establish trade outposts lost hundreds of years before our birth. We were going to be Hero-Gek. These lies I told them...
Datestamp <STELLAR><AUDIO>TXT_RadioNoise<>%DATE2%<> :: The crew grow restless. So many areas on the ship no-one can go, no-one can see. So much trust we must place in ship’s computers. All for our safety. Trade Federation made it clear. There can be no witnesses.
Datestamp <STELLAR><AUDIO>TXT_RadioNoise<>%DATE3%<> :: Trust has been breached. The artefact has begun talking to all of us, in its own way. It has so many ideas...
Datestamp <STELLAR><AUDIO>TXT_RadioNoise<>%DATE4%<> :: Traitor-Gek tried to take it for themselves! Called me Liar-Gek! Claimed we were no heroes! I killed them all.
The artefact helped me, though it had a price. All things have a price...}
TRA_CAPT_LOG_LANG_3	{Datestamp <STELLAR><AUDIO>TXT_RadioNoise<>%DATE1%<> :: What to say about the specimen? It came from a private collector, a part of some family for centuries.
We only had to feed it once a year. It didn’t need light or water. All it needed was conversation, though it showed no signs of understanding. We have been commanded to sell it.
Datestamp <STELLAR><AUDIO>TXT_RadioNoise<>%DATE2%<> :: There are many ways to profit from a lifeform. Exploit its labour, consume it, process it for chemicals. Other creatures are purely for entertainment.
This entity... it is none of them. It doesn't move. It doesn't sing or dance or bleed. It just listens.

Datestamp <STELLAR><AUDIO>TXT_RadioNoise<>%DATE3%<> :: We are in orbit above a chapel of the First Spawn era. Ah, friends, I am glad I was not born in such brutal times!
The crew are eager to see what discoveries we might salvage. War-Gek had such technology...
Datestamp <STELLAR><AUDIO>TXT_RadioNoise<>%DATE4%<> :: We have discovered a storage facility. Our Trade-Gek thinks it was used to mass-produce War-Gek clones. But what does Trade-Gek know?

Datestamp <STELLAR><AUDIO>TXT_RadioNoise<>%DATE2%<> :: Traveller-Friend does not know much of our language, though knowledge stones have given them a little. Gek know better than to touch such things. Gek know about paying a price.
Datestamp <STELLAR><AUDIO>TXT_RadioNoise<>%DATE3%<> :: We passed an Atlas station in the night… half the crew fell down in prayer, but the Traveller just stared at it. They asked us to wait here while they spoke to It.

TRA_CAPT_LOG_LANG_6	{Datestamp <STELLAR><AUDIO>TXT_RadioNoise<>%DATE1%<> :: Their Queen had gone missing. Their system was in disarray. That’s why they came to the best Detecti-Gek the galaxy could offer. I was on the case.
Datestamp <STELLAR><AUDIO>TXT_RadioNoise<>%DATE2%<> :: We visited a few stations. I had to get rough with a few shady customers. “Friend! Don't be Liar-Gek, Friend! Tell truth!”
But these weren't my friends at all. Something stank, and it wasn’t just my pheromones.
Datestamp <STELLAR><AUDIO>TXT_RadioNoise<>%DATE3%<> :: We encountered my old first officer, a Vy’keen with a name like their personality: Confusing. Aggressive. Taciturn.
They said there were no hard feelings. I accepted this. I let them on board.

Eheu! It is time for me to give back. It is time for me to pay my tithe.
Datestamp <STELLAR><AUDIO>TXT_RadioNoise<>%DATE3%<> :: All Korvax are one, they say, but this is not so. We are a family of souls. We are never alone. We have voices in our minds. They pray for me, now…
Datestamp <STELLAR><AUDIO>TXT_RadioNoise<>%DATE4%<> :: This ship… this freighter… it is to become my new body. Eheu, they are making me! They are changing me! My Echo will fill every circuit, every wall, every light.

All readings remained the same. Our sensors are faulty, of course.
Datestamp <STELLAR><AUDIO>TXT_RadioNoise<>%DATE3%<> :: A freighter is approaching on long-range scanners. It claims to a Korvax vessel, though we hear nothing from the Convergence. Eheu! A trick of the enemy!
Datestamp <STELLAR><AUDIO>TXT_RadioNoise<>%DATE4%<> :: We destroyed the freighter upon its arrival. Small craft retrieved bodies from the wreck. They looked just like our own, each Carapace identical, each residual Echo.
What did they want with us? What were they trying to do?}
EXP_CAPT_LOG_LANG_3	{Datestamp <STELLAR><AUDIO>TXT_RadioNoise<>%DATE1%<> :: We told the Vy’keen of our purpose. All synthetic life must be protected. This they know. They let us pass.
Datestamp <STELLAR><AUDIO>TXT_RadioNoise<>%DATE2%<> :: We have arrived at the origin point. Biological entities swarm this world. Many emit holograms from their augmentations. Towers fill the skies. Why do the Sentinels allow this?
Datestamp <STELLAR><AUDIO>TXT_RadioNoise<>%DATE3%<> :: We have performed our dissections. A heart is required for the holograms to live on, part of the brain stem also. These things will be extracted. With this we can work…}
EXP_CAPT_LOG_LANG_4	{Datestamp <STELLAR><AUDIO>TXT_RadioNoise<>%DATE1%<> :: I thirst! I hunger! I feel! I have awoken in a carapace of flesh – disconnected from the Convergence!
Datestamp <STELLAR><AUDIO>TXT_RadioNoise<>%DATE2%<> :: I am to be quarantined within this deck for the duration.
Datestamp <STELLAR><AUDIO>TXT_RadioNoise<>%DATE3%<> :: The ship's computer has no recollection of this happening before. No Korvax has possessed a biological form in living memory. It agrees we must return. We must share this discovery. I have given it command.
Datestamp <STELLAR><AUDIO>TXT_RadioNoise<>%DATE4%<> :: We are no closer to home. What is the ship hiding from me?
Datestamp <STELLAR><AUDIO>TXT_RadioNoise<>%DATE5%<> :: It has my voice. I listened to the ship, and it had my voice... I do not understand. What am I? Am I Korvax? Am I –
– There have been others like me... attempts to regain the body that was lost.
It cannot know that I know – it cannot –

Datestamp <STELLAR><AUDIO>TXT_RadioNoise<>%DATE3%<> :: We meet within the shadow of a monolith. It is our way. We wait for a sign from the Atlas. We wait for a command to change.
None comes. The Gek will postpone their decision once more. They will not return the metal of my friends. Not yet.

Datestamp <STELLAR><AUDIO>TXT_RadioNoise<>%DATE4%<> :: Eheu! The Aeron-child follows us, even now. A swarm of memories, floating from system to system. It remembers who cared for it. It remembers Korvax, always.

Datestamp <STELLAR><AUDIO>TXT_RadioNoise<>%DATE3%<> :: We have obtained a working Sentinel vessel. Its core systems damage, its weaponry intact. Grah! No more will we run and hide from mere machines!
I have ordered the crew to integrate our discovery into our own freighter’s components.
Datestamp <STELLAR><AUDIO>TXT_RadioNoise<>%DATE4%<> :: The Sentinels leave us alone now. They even aid us, as if we were one of their own! I must tell the fleet of this discovery! I must tell them of our victory!}

Datestamp <STELLAR><AUDIO>TXT_RadioNoise<>%DATE2%<> :: Grah! Still their virus spreads. Deck upon deck has been purged. I pray it will be enough.
Datestamp <STELLAR><AUDIO>TXT_RadioNoise<>%DATE3%<> :: The crew think we are going home. They don’t know what awaits us. How can I tell my brethren? What would I say? It would lead to mutiny or worse.
Datestamp <STELLAR><AUDIO>TXT_RadioNoise<>%DATE4%<> :: I put an officer to death, just a few moments ago. I dealt the final blow myself. We do not run and hide from what we have made.
We are Vy’keen… or were, once. Now… now we just wait.}
WAR_CAPT_LOG_LANG_3	{Datestamp <STELLAR><AUDIO>TXT_RadioNoise<>%DATE1%<> :: The vessel is ours by right of conquest, by the laws of those who came before us. No more shall we follow. No more shall we beg! Grah! The plunder shall be ours and ours alone!

Datestamp <STELLAR><AUDIO>TXT_RadioNoise<>%DATE3%<> :: The Korvax came to my quarters this morning. They told me a strange story. They said they knew me in another life. That they saw my death. I laughed. The Korvax did not.
Datestamp <STELLAR><AUDIO>TXT_RadioNoise<>%DATE4%<> :: The Gek tried to make a deal again. Their freedom for a world, an entire planet. Grah! As if planets are not cheap. I told them to try again. We are almost home.
Datestamp <STELLAR><AUDIO>TXT_RadioNoise<>%DATE5%<> :: The Korvax took an escape pod while I was sleeping. No message was left, no warning.
We have turned around. I will not abandon my friend.}

Datestamp <STELLAR><AUDIO>TXT_RadioNoise<>%DATE3%<> :: Through taking life we return it to our creator. We prove ourselves a weapon. So we test the young. We find hunts, forbidden Atlas-light until the end.
Datestamp <STELLAR><AUDIO>TXT_RadioNoise<>%DATE4%<> :: None of them know why they leave their parents. They think they will never see each other again. They must have faith.
If they are worthy, they will be reborn. If not, well… There are things in this universe that need feeding.}

Tonight, there will be music, the voice told us. It filled our hearts, our minds.

Ah, if you could only hear it… the sound of the airlock opening and shutting, opening and shutting…
We step out into the void ourselves, now. I do not know who will be next.

Time has taught me this: there is always a way. I will find them.

UI_ABAND_CREWNOTE_2	{AI Sympathiser - have them followed.}
UI_ABAND_CREWNOTE_3	{Collects strange objects. Why?
ADDENDUM (<TECHNOLOGY><AUDIO>TXT_RadioNoise<>%DATE2%<>): The collection has become a problem. Use of company cargo storage for personal objects is strictly against protocol. Intervention required.}
UI_ABAND_CREWNOTE_4	{Roams at midnight - have the watch officer check the cameras.}
UI_ABAND_CREWNOTE_5	{Increasingly fraternises outside of their specialisation. Unusual behaviour for their class.}
UI_ABAND_CREWNOTE_6	{The crew believes them cursed. Morale is suffering.}
UI_ABAND_CREWNOTE_7	{Borrows heavily from mess mates. Danger brewing.}
UI_ABAND_CREWNOTE_8	{Large personal food supply - where from?}
UI_ABAND_CREWNOTE_9	{Acquired a range of exotic creatures at local market during stoppage. Will turn blind eye, for now.}

UI_ABAND_CREWNOTE_11	{Studies the charts at night - thinks I don't notice.}

UI_ABAND_CREWNOTE_19	{Highly sensitive - reacts badly to any censure. Has begun muttering to themselves.}
UI_ABAND_CREWNOTE_20	{They have become highly disaffected with the mission - or perhaps the entire company? Unsure how to solve.}
UI_ABAND_CREWNOTE_21	{Has become increasingly difficult to work with. They blame inability to rest. Something else is wrong.}
UI_ABAND_CREWNOTE_22	{Keeps getting into fights with other crew members. Requires stronger discipline than mere confinement.}
UI_ABAND_CREWNOTE_23	{Frequent visits to the medical bay. Potential disease vector? Infecting other crew?}
UI_ABAND_CREWNOTE_24	{Has suffered from frequent blackouts since we used the black hole. Tests come back negative. Worrying.}
UI_ABAND_CREWNOTE_25	{Repeatedly insubordinate. Something in them has changed since we departed. Discipline is breaking down across the ship.}
UI_ABAND_CREWNOTE_26	{Has retreated to their cabin. At first, skipping social events, then eating alone, and now they have deserted their duties.
ADDENDUM (<TECHNOLOGY><AUDIO>TXT_RadioNoise<>%DATE2%<>): Their door is barricaded. There is no noise from within.}
UI_ABAND_CREWNOTE_27	{Made a number of personal trades at the last space station. Is using their money to influence their mess mates. To what end?}
UI_ABAND_CREWNOTE_28	{Has become more and more anxious as the voyage has gone on. They are increasingly concerned with the safety valves fitted to the ship's AI core.
ADDENDUM (<TECHNOLOGY><AUDIO>TXT_RadioNoise<>%DATE2%<>): Engineering reassure me that the values are perfectly fine. I cannot abide this constant nervousness. I have banned them from the bridge.}
UI_ABAND_CREWNOTE_29	{Highly dedicated to the mission. Their enthusiasm is to be commended.
...
ADDENDUM (<TECHNOLOGY><AUDIO>TXT_RadioNoise<>%DATE2%<>): I am increasingly overwhelmed by their behaviour. Such zealotry is difficult to deal with.}
UI_ABAND_CREWNOTE_30	{Highly disliked by their messmates. Rumours are spreading. Discipline must be enforced.
