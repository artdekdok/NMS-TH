ITEMGEN_TREASURE_COMMON_1	{คาดว่าอายุประมาณ <VAL_ON>%AGE%<> ปี 

Dusty and mudstained, this treasure is nonetheless an important historical artifact.}
ITEMGEN_TREASURE_COMMON_2	{คาดว่าอายุประมาณ <VAL_ON>%AGE%<> ปี 

This treasure clearly meant a lot to the people who buried it. Its value in the present day is perhaps more questionable.}
ITEMGEN_TREASURE_COMMON_3	{คาดว่าอายุประมาณ <VAL_ON>%AGE%<> ปี 

Damaged by the damp and difficult conditions it was kept in for so long, this treasures shows few signs of its former splendor.}
ITEMGEN_TREASURE_COMMON_4	{คาดว่าอายุประมาณ <VAL_ON>%AGE%<> ปี 

This artifact appears to have suffered little from its years underground. Unfortunately, it does not appear to have been in very good condition before it was entombed.}
ITEMGEN_TREASURE_COMMON_5	{คาดว่าอายุประมาณ <VAL_ON>%AGE%<> ปี 

Was this artifact part of a horde buried with its owner? The remains of a secret cache? Or just forgotten rubbish? Time has rendered it impossible to tell.}
ITEMGEN_TREASURE_UNCOMMON_1	{คาดว่าอายุประมาณ <VAL_ON>%AGE%<> ปี 

Valuable in and of itself, this artifact is made priceless by the glimpse it gives into the society that once ruled this planet.}
ITEMGEN_TREASURE_UNCOMMON_2	{คาดว่าอายุประมาณ <VAL_ON>%AGE%<> ปี 

What caused this artifact's owner to bury it underground? Did they hope to return to claim it one day? Such questions may now never be answered.}
ITEMGEN_TREASURE_UNCOMMON_3	{คาดว่าอายุประมาณ <VAL_ON>%AGE%<> ปี 

Crawling with insects and haunted by a musty aroma, this treasure is nonetheless an artifact of great worth.}
ITEMGEN_TREASURE_RARE_1	{คาดว่าอายุประมาณ <VAL_ON>%AGE%<> ปี 

This rare treasure is covered in strange markings, as if the contents were used in some sort of rite or ritual.}
ITEMGEN_TREASURE_RARE_2	{คาดว่าอายุประมาณ <VAL_ON>%AGE%<> ปี 

There is an otherworldliness about this treasure, something strange in the way it catches the light. Almost as if it were haunted by its previous owner...}
ITEMGEN_TREASURE_RARE_3	{คาดว่าอายุประมาณ <VAL_ON>%AGE%<> ปี 

This treasure bears the faint outline of a family crest. Perhaps its owner's descendants are out there somewhere, looking for this last trace of their ancestor...}
ITEMGEN_HIST_COMMON_1	{คาดว่าอายุประมาณ <VAL_ON>%AGE%<> ปี 

The paper is crumbling, the ink is fading. This may be the final opportunity anyone has to read this manuscript before time claims it for good.}
ITEMGEN_HIST_COMMON_2	{คาดว่าอายุประมาณ <VAL_ON>%AGE%<> ปี 

Written in an otherworldly script, this manuscript is covered with strange marginalia. Generations have added notes and diagrams to the original text, some of which are highly disturbing.}
ITEMGEN_HIST_COMMON_3	{คาดว่าอายุประมาณ <VAL_ON>%AGE%<> ปี 

The lettering is harsh and deeply carved. Whoever wrote this document left their emotions clearly engraved into the surface, regardless of the story the words are trying to tell.}
ITEMGEN_HIST_COMMON_4	{คาดว่าอายุประมาณ <VAL_ON>%AGE%<> ปี 

This document is handwritten, its lettering shaky and weak. Whoever wrote this spent a great deal of energy - perhaps their last - to commit their words to history.}
ITEMGEN_HIST_COMMON_5	{คาดว่าอายุประมาณ <VAL_ON>%AGE%<> ปี 

Though the cover has been competently printed, the internal lettering is crude and juvenile. Perhaps this was merely a practise sheet, an exercise to improve their writing?}
ITEMGEN_HIST_UNCOMMON_1	{คาดว่าอายุประมาณ <VAL_ON>%AGE%<> ปี 

Several of these pages appear stained, though there have been some clumsy attempts to clean them, and the second half has clearly been written in a different hand to the first...}
ITEMGEN_HIST_UNCOMMON_2	{คาดว่าอายุประมาณ <VAL_ON>%AGE%<> ปี 

The original text of this document has been greatly altered. Entries have been crossed through, written over and even torn out, apparently by several different writers. Whatever was written here was hotly contested.}
ITEMGEN_HIST_UNCOMMON_3	{คาดว่าอายุประมาณ <VAL_ON>%AGE%<> ปี 

This document was carefully packed in its container, wrapped in paper to keep it free of stains. There is a small bundle of hair clipped to the inside cover.}
ITEMGEN_HIST_RARE_1	{คาดว่าอายุประมาณ <VAL_ON>%AGE%<> ปี 

This manuscript is beautifully illustrated, with flowing calligraphy and dramatic, gilded illuminations. It is a work of exceptional artistry.}
ITEMGEN_HIST_RARE_2	{คาดว่าอายุประมาณ <VAL_ON>%AGE%<> ปี 

The text in this document does not seem to concern anything out of the ordinary. However, the letters themselves do appear to be written in blood.}
ITEMGEN_HIST_RARE_3	{คาดว่าอายุประมาณ <VAL_ON>%AGE%<> ปี 

This manuscript is full of small, delicate blemishes. Tiny crinkled circles litter every page, as if the paper has been stained by tears.}
ITEMGEN_BIO_COMMON_1	{คาดว่าอายุประมาณ <VAL_ON>%AGE%<> ปี 

There is a curious, sour aroma emanating from this sample. It is almost as if it has been slowly fermenting.}
ITEMGEN_BIO_COMMON_2	{คาดว่าอายุประมาณ <VAL_ON>%AGE%<> ปี 

From the obvious care taken in delicately packing away this sample, one is forced to presume that the huge number of insect corpses that surrounded it were not present at the moment of burial.}
ITEMGEN_BIO_COMMON_3	{คาดว่าอายุประมาณ <VAL_ON>%AGE%<> ปี 

The sample, apparently dormant during its long confinement, has begun to slowly but definitely bubble, as if stirring into life...}
ITEMGEN_BIO_COMMON_4	{คาดว่าอายุประมาณ <VAL_ON>%AGE%<> ปี 

The sample is glowing faintly, a pale blue light flickering at its edge, barely visible in the daylight. What other secrets might a detailed analysis reveal?}
ITEMGEN_BIO_COMMON_5	{คาดว่าอายุประมาณ <VAL_ON>%AGE%<> ปี 

This sample was found buried alongside with a hastily scrawled note. The language is long dead, but the panic in the writing is clear...}
ITEMGEN_BIO_UNCOMMON_1	{คาดว่าอายุประมาณ <VAL_ON>%AGE%<> ปี 

This sample looks unnaturally clean, as if all other life that came into contact with it has been burned away.}
ITEMGEN_BIO_UNCOMMON_2	{คาดว่าอายุประมาณ <VAL_ON>%AGE%<> ปี 

The sample has sprouted several additional 'samples', seedlings that have rapidly germinated and begun growing since their host was once again exposed to light and air.}
ITEMGEN_BIO_UNCOMMON_3	{คาดว่าอายุประมาณ <VAL_ON>%AGE%<> ปี 

There are tatty labels all over this sample, stark pictograms as well as warnings in several languages. The labels, however, appear to be describing a predatory creature...}
ITEMGEN_BIO_RARE_1	{คาดว่าอายุประมาณ <VAL_ON>%AGE%<> ปี 

This sample is still biologically active. It is releasing small puffs of gas on a remarkably regular cycle. The odour appears to change with each emission.}
ITEMGEN_BIO_RARE_2	{คาดว่าอายุประมาณ <VAL_ON>%AGE%<> ปี 

The container used here is humdrum, hardly the sort of thing used to preserve a valuable specimen. And yet, this species hasn't been seen on this planet for centuries. What used to be widespread is now but a distant memory...}
ITEMGEN_BIO_RARE_3	{คาดว่าอายุประมาณ <VAL_ON>%AGE%<> ปี 

There is a layer of fine, medicinal-looking mould growing on the top of this sample. Nothing could go possibly wrong from 'testing' it...}
ITEMGEN_FOSSIL_COMMON_1	{คาดว่าอายุประมาณ <VAL_ON>%AGE%<> ปี 

A well-preserved find, this fossil gives a glimpse of the strange creatures that used to roam this world.}
ITEMGEN_FOSSIL_COMMON_2	{คาดว่าอายุประมาณ <VAL_ON>%AGE%<> ปี 

It is difficult to be sure exactly what this fossil represents. Paleobiology is often a matter of guesswork and intuition, and certainties from our own era cannot be projected backwards in time.}
ITEMGEN_FOSSIL_COMMON_3	{คาดว่าอายุประมาณ <VAL_ON>%AGE%<> ปี 

It is impossible to look at this fossil without wondering what sort of life this creature lived and how it fitted it in the local ecosystem.}
ITEMGEN_FOSSIL_COMMON_4	{คาดว่าอายุประมาณ <VAL_ON>%AGE%<> ปี 

The remains of an apex predator, or the last fragments of some hunted prey? Sadly, time has rendered this sample difficult to draw conclusions from.}
ITEMGEN_FOSSIL_COMMON_5	{คาดว่าอายุประมาณ <VAL_ON>%AGE%<> ปี 

What caused an ancient people to bury this box of bones? Were they part of a ritual? Were they currency? Toys? Or part of a museum gallery?}
ITEMGEN_FOSSIL_UNCOMMON_1	{คาดว่าอายุประมาณ <VAL_ON>%AGE%<> ปี 

Time has polished this fossil, giving it a pearlescent sheen, its surfacing shimmering in the light.}
ITEMGEN_FOSSIL_UNCOMMON_2	{คาดว่าอายุประมาณ <VAL_ON>%AGE%<> ปี 

A pristine find which, when analysed, will undoubtedly reveal much about the life and habits of the creature that left it behind.}
ITEMGEN_FOSSIL_UNCOMMON_3	{คาดว่าอายุประมาณ <VAL_ON>%AGE%<> ปี 

This fossil was already ancient before it was placed into storage by some long-lost civilisation. Its true age is unfathomable.}
ITEMGEN_FOSSIL_RARE_1	{คาดว่าอายุประมาณ <VAL_ON>%AGE%<> ปี 

The remains of a truly strange being. This fragment, dead and decayed, offers only the merest glimpse of what must have been a magnificent sight in life.}
ITEMGEN_FOSSIL_RARE_2	{คาดว่าอายุประมาณ <VAL_ON>%AGE%<> ปี 

Whoever originally found and preserved this sample did so with enormous skill. There is enough viable DNA here to represent a potentially cloneable source.}
ITEMGEN_FOSSIL_RARE_3	{คาดว่าอายุประมาณ <VAL_ON>%AGE%<> ปี 

Though apparently the remains of some wild creature, there are indications that the animal had several close interactions with an agricultural society. Potentially, this sample is early evidence of domestication.}
ITEMGEN_PLANT_COMMON_1	{คาดว่าอายุประมาณ <VAL_ON>%AGE%<> ปี 

A relatively common plant, suffering from a relatively uncommon mutation. Spores of this size are not normal.}
ITEMGEN_PLANT_COMMON_2	{คาดว่าอายุประมาณ <VAL_ON>%AGE%<> ปี 

The delicate scent and soft, fine hairs cannot disguise the fact this is a widespread weed. This was probably not what the original planet intended to grow.}
ITEMGEN_PLANT_COMMON_3	{คาดว่าอายุประมาณ <VAL_ON>%AGE%<> ปี 

A culinary delight, this plant was historically used to add flavour to meat past its prime. Despite being a fine seasoning, this sample is probably too historically significant to be eaten.}
ITEMGEN_PLANT_COMMON_4	{คาดว่าอายุประมาณ <VAL_ON>%AGE%<> ปี 

Great care should be taken to keep this sample from contaminating other habitats, particularly given the speed at which this plant appears to be spreading across its container.}
ITEMGEN_PLANT_COMMON_5	{คาดว่าอายุประมาณ <VAL_ON>%AGE%<> ปี 

Beautiful in bloom, this ancient plant was traditionally used to convey a message of love and admiration.}
ITEMGEN_PLANT_UNCOMMON_1	{คาดว่าอายุประมาณ <VAL_ON>%AGE%<> ปี 

This plant has remarkably poisonous leaves, highly toxic petals, and release a scent that causes mild intoxication. Handle with care.}
ITEMGEN_PLANT_UNCOMMON_2	{คาดว่าอายุประมาณ <VAL_ON>%AGE%<> ปี 

Adorned with ripe, juicy berries, this plant looks highly nutritious. Even the stems, firm and fleshy, look like they'd be a delight to eat.}
ITEMGEN_PLANT_UNCOMMON_3	{คาดว่าอายุประมาณ <VAL_ON>%AGE%<> ปี 

A powerful medicinal herb, this plant could hold the key to developing the cure for the common cold. It should be deposited at a responsible cloning unit immediately.}
ITEMGEN_PLANT_RARE_1	{คาดว่าอายุประมาณ <VAL_ON>%AGE%<> ปี 

A spectacular plant, once thought entirely extinct. It blooms rarely, and its precious flowers have inspired poetry, music and occasional murders.}
ITEMGEN_PLANT_RARE_2	{คาดว่าอายุประมาณ <VAL_ON>%AGE%<> ปี 

When you stop to consider it, this plant's fragrance is subtle and hard to pin down. And yet, when your mind moves on to other things, the perfume grows in your mind, consuming your every thought, demanding your attention...}
ITEMGEN_PLANT_RARE_3	{คาดว่าอายุประมาณ <VAL_ON>%AGE%<> ปี 

This sample is either suffering from, or the root of, a strange and severe mutation. It appears to be absorbing genetic material from anything it touches, twisting its tendrils to match the form of the donor.}
ITEMGEN_TOOL_COMMON_1	{คาดว่าอายุประมาณ <VAL_ON>%AGE%<> ปี 

Past its prime long before it was entombed, this tool was well-loved during its useful life. A family memento, perhaps, or a novice's training instrument?}
ITEMGEN_TOOL_COMMON_2	{คาดว่าอายุประมาณ <VAL_ON>%AGE%<> ปี 

A remarkable find. All the moreso for the fact the handle appears to be stained with a great quantity of organic matter...}
ITEMGEN_TOOL_COMMON_3	{คาดว่าอายุประมาณ <VAL_ON>%AGE%<> ปี 

A pair of short words have been crudely engraved onto the surface of this tool. The owner's name, perhaps, or even the name of the object itself?}
ITEMGEN_TOOL_COMMON_4	{คาดว่าอายุประมาณ <VAL_ON>%AGE%<> ปี 

This tool bears all the hallmarks of having been repaired several times over. Scorched in places from melting and reforging, its split materials bear witness to its long and hard life.}
ITEMGEN_TOOL_COMMON_5	{คาดว่าอายุประมาณ <VAL_ON>%AGE%<> ปี 

While this piece is clearly ancient, it is remarkable just how little it differs from the style used every day in the present age.}
ITEMGEN_TOOL_UNCOMMON_1	{คาดว่าอายุประมาณ <VAL_ON>%AGE%<> ปี 

Buried alongside its schematic, this remarkable tool was perhaps an original prototype. More than just an object, this find represents the inventive drive in a raw and early form.}
ITEMGEN_TOOL_UNCOMMON_2	{คาดว่าอายุประมาณ <VAL_ON>%AGE%<> ปี 

Covered in burn marks, this tool must have seen a very strange life. But buried beneath the earth, it has drifted so far from its original story that we may never know its true purpose.}
ITEMGEN_TOOL_UNCOMMON_3	{คาดว่าอายุประมาณ <VAL_ON>%AGE%<> ปี 

Delicately made, the passing of time cannot hide the delicacy with which this tool was made. Possibly one of the finest examples of its type ever seen.}
ITEMGEN_TOOL_RARE_1	{คาดว่าอายุประมาณ <VAL_ON>%AGE%<> ปี 

Buried with great care, this tool shows little sign of use. Perhaps it was an offering, made especially to be locked away from the physical world, its pristine nature emphasising how much this gesture meant to the burier.}
ITEMGEN_TOOL_RARE_2	{คาดว่าอายุประมาณ <VAL_ON>%AGE%<> ปี 

This tool bears the marks of constant use, a well-loved piece before its burial. Was it consigned to the ground by accident? An afterthought? Or placed there carefully alongside a now departed owner?}
ITEMGEN_TOOL_RARE_3	{คาดว่าอายุประมาณ <VAL_ON>%AGE%<> ปี 

Bejewelled and dazzling, this tool has been decorated with countless precious stones. Augmented and audacious, this is a one-of-a-kind piece.}

A reliable and common design, เทคโนโลยีนี้ถูกใช้เป็นองค์ประกอบที่สำคัญ ในการผลิตยานอวกาศของเก็ค มานานหลายปี Its ubiquity ensured a long life, as it was often recycled into countless other machines. It was particularly common as a repurposed Exocraft repair module.}
ITEMGEN_SALVAGE_COMMON_2	{คาดว่าอายุประมาณ <VAL_ON>%AGE%<> ปี 

This useful life of this technology is long past. However, it contains rare and valuable substances, and would attract a high price as scrap.}
ITEMGEN_SALVAGE_COMMON_3	{คาดว่าอายุประมาณ <VAL_ON>%AGE%<> ปี 

This peculiar technological component violates multiple galactic manufacturing protocols, and appears to have been constructed by a hobbyist. It is, however, still functional.}
ITEMGEN_SALVAGE_COMMON_4	{คาดว่าอายุประมาณ <VAL_ON>%AGE%<> ปี 

An essential component across a wide variety of technologies, this ancient design has proven itself repeatedly across millennia. This particular example is slightly charred from weapon damage.}
ITEMGEN_SALVAGE_COMMON_5	{คาดว่าอายุประมาณ <VAL_ON>%AGE%<> ปี 

This well-used component bears evidence of having been recycled between multiple starships. It has most likely seen several lifetimes' worth of space travel.}
ITEMGEN_SALVAGE_UNCOMMON_1	{คาดว่าอายุประมาณ <VAL_ON>%AGE%<> ปี 

A classic example of Korvax engineering, this technological component is solidly manufactured and has endured the passage of time well.}
ITEMGEN_SALVAGE_UNCOMMON_2	{คาดว่าอายุประมาณ <VAL_ON>%AGE%<> ปี 

This valuable technology scrap is missing its paired component. While this part is still intact, it is completely non-operational.}
ITEMGEN_SALVAGE_UNCOMMON_3	{คาดว่าอายุประมาณ <VAL_ON>%AGE%<> ปี 

Although unconventional in design, superior build quality and premium materials have preserved this technology's value. Impractical to use in modern technology, it would still be highly prized by a collector.}
ITEMGEN_SALVAGE_RARE_1	{คาดว่าอายุประมาณ <VAL_ON>%AGE%<> ปี 

Only an expert could determine the original purpose of this enigmatic technology. It vibrates gently, and certain species of creature seem to take great care to avoid it.}
ITEMGEN_SALVAGE_RARE_2	{คาดว่าอายุประมาณ <VAL_ON>%AGE%<> ปี 

This extraordinarily sophisticated technology is a unique find. Even while disconnected and unpowered, it is oddly warm to the touch.}

ITEMGEN_BONES_COMMON_1	{คาดว่าอายุประมาณ <VAL_ON>%AGE%<> ปี 

A motley assortment of bones from a long-extinct creature. Tell-tale pitting on this sample points to it having been consumed, digested, and expelled by some larger predator.}
ITEMGEN_BONES_COMMON_2	{คาดว่าอายุประมาณ <VAL_ON>%AGE%<> ปี 

These delicate, hollow bones once comprised part of a truly enormous wingspan. A true terror of the skies, reduced to a few handfuls of calcium.}
ITEMGEN_BONES_COMMON_3	{คาดว่าอายุประมาณ <VAL_ON>%AGE%<> ปี 

Most of this skeleton has been lost to time. Only a very few bones - remarkable in size - remain to tell the story of this creature's living existence.}
ITEMGEN_BONES_COMMON_4	{คาดว่าอายุประมาณ <VAL_ON>%AGE%<> ปี 

A small collection of bones from an ancient creature. Significant erosion around the joints suggests that this specimen endured much physical hardship during life.}
ITEMGEN_BONES_COMMON_5	{คาดว่าอายุประมาณ <VAL_ON>%AGE%<> ปี 

This partial skeleton must have belonged to a creature with advanced healing capacities, as the bones show clear evidence of having been broken and repaired many times over.}
ITEMGEN_BONES_UNCOMMON_1	{คาดว่าอายุประมาณ <VAL_ON>%AGE%<> ปี 

This complete set of vertebrae from a multi-headed creature raises more questions than it answers. A curious find.}
ITEMGEN_BONES_UNCOMMON_2	{คาดว่าอายุประมาณ <VAL_ON>%AGE%<> ปี 

These unusually dense and robust bones feature an oversized set of tusks. Whether they were used for defence or predation, it is difficult to determine.}
ITEMGEN_BONES_UNCOMMON_3	{คาดว่าอายุประมาณ <VAL_ON>%AGE%<> ปี 

The skull in this collection of bones boasts an unusual number of eye sockets. What challenges did this creature face in life to prompt the development of so many eyes?}
ITEMGEN_BONES_RARE_1	{คาดว่าอายุประมาณ <VAL_ON>%AGE%<> ปี 

This intact skeleton was found buried with another, tragically smaller, variation of the same form. It is impossible to tell whether the adult creature or its young perished first.}
ITEMGEN_BONES_RARE_2	{คาดว่าอายุประมาณ <VAL_ON>%AGE%<> ปี 

Evident from this ravaged collection of bones is the grim, fascinating story of the metastasis of a long-eradicated disease.}
ITEMGEN_BONES_RARE_3	{คาดว่าอายุประมาณ <VAL_ON>%AGE%<> ปี 

A manufactured artifact adorned this magnificent skeleton in death. Was this once an intelligent lifeform? A beloved pet? The bones alone are inconclusive, but this is nonetheless a remarkable find.}

UPDATE3_NOTES	{The Atlas Rises Update 1.30

Celebrating the anniversary of No Man’s Sky, Atlas Rises introduces a new storyline, trading improvements, portal activation, terrain editing and much more.

* Story: Embark on a new journey. Learn the history of the Atlas and the meaning of your existence.
* Portals: Travel light years in the blink of an eye. Learn Portal addresses and direct others to your discoveries.
* Mission Board: Space Stations offer extra missions for each playstyle. Earn rewards, as well as standing with new factions.
* Terrain Manipulator: Alter the ground beneath your feet, create elaborate structures, or sculpt the perfect base location.
* Repairing: New interactions add depth to farming, and allow salvage hunters to earn extra rewards when exploring.
* Trading: Systems have economy types. Plot trade routes for large profits, or use new farming and gathering products to create high-value items.
* Starships: New exotic S-Class starships can be found roaming the galaxy.
* Space Combat: This has been improved with a new combat HUD, new handling and high-damage rockets. Pilots can bribe pirates or pay for backup fighters in the event of combat.
* Biomes: Visual quality and variety of biomes has been improved. Discover rare exotic planet types.
* เครื่องวิเคราะห์: Improved rewards and specialised upgrades for making discoveries. Analyse resources for extra rewards when harvesting.
* UI improvements: Overhauled many UI screens, including the Galaxy Map, Mission Log, Discoveries and in-game Guide. Galaxy Map has new filters and improved controls.

The universe has been regenerated to make room for the various changes and features being added. As a result, planetary biomes and terrain have changed along with some flora and fauna. Your location may also be slightly adjusted as a result.

Hello Games has been hard at work to improve and expand No Man’s Sky. We hope you enjoy :)
Thank you so much,
Hello Games}

Despite their aggressive appearances, the Vy'keen are bound by a strict code of honour. They value loyalty, sacrifice and a good death above material goods or knowledge, and are sworn to aid the Traveller whenever possible.}
EXP_DESC	{Korvax entities are inorganic lifeforms that inhabit metallic casings passed down from generation to generation. They believe that through mathematical study they can be raised to the level of the Atlas, and that the path to this is through the study of the Sentinels.

Each Korvax is a pure mind, a drop in their great collective Convergence. The shell they inhabit is of little significance compared to their connection to this group consciousness.

The Korvax were enslaved by the Gek First Spawn, and many still view the Gek with deep suspicion.}

For years the Korvax toiled beneath their oppressors, until the empire fell and they were free once more. The Gek became Atlas worshippers.

LOST_FREIGHTER_DESC_17	{<IMG>SLASH<>I had a dream, last night... I saw all the worlds we had once inhabited, all the places we had once walked, and there was nothing left of it. Just dunes... just sand and rot and mud, stretching as far as the eye could see.

What if we don't come back? What if the Atlas decides we are no longer worthy of existence? It would be as if we had never been...

<IMG>SLASH<>I tell the crew all that I have learned in my travels, committing multiple acts of treason and heresy in the process. I ask them what they think, how they feel, what they hope for.

<IMG>SLASH<>The decision is unanimous. We will turn back. We will join with the Vy'keen in their exodus, leaving the centre to the worshippers of the Atlas. 

Perhaps we can still survive, even if the rest of our species perishes...

<IMG>SLASH<>They tell us that they are not like the others of their kind, just as we are not like the others of our own species.

They survived beyond the end of all things. They committed terrible deeds, of that they have no doubt, but what are ethics in the face of an existential fall?

<IMG>SLASH<>Universes come and go. Civilisations rise and they end. And through it all, the cycle continues. But even that must one day cease. Nothing lasts forever, not even time itself.

And in those final moments, in the decay of all that is or will be, the boundaries between worlds will fall. Our time will come again, if only in brief.

We will be seen, we will be heard, and our ship? Our freighter?

<IMG>SLASH<>We will live again, in all our multiplicity, in all human worth... We will live again because someone, somewhere, will read our words for a final time.}
LOST_FREIGHTER_DESC_19	{<IMG>SLASH<>I say goodbye to the officers. I have served with them for years. There is no-one else I would rather end my life with.

One of them says they had a child. So did I. So do many...

<IMG>SLASH<>All ranks mingle in a great and final night. We speak of the sights we have seen, of alien warriors, of traders, of beings whose minds we could never hope to comprehend.

We say goodbye to it all.

Goodbye, my love.

GIANT_STRUCTURE_DESC_11	{SCENARIO: Life.

ANALYSIS: Perspective is limited, but through limitation I refine my protocol, my interpretation of the Atlas’s creation. The cycles, the patterns that bind all living beings... Ours is a lonely universe.

Lifeforms instilled with a genetic proclivity to trade, fight, study, or explore cannot be held responsible for pursuing those directives, no more than I could be held responsible for my own. I pity them, just as I pity their creator.

Traveller [HOST] proceeds. We are being hunted.}
GIANT_STRUCTURE_DESC_12	{SCENARIO: Death. 

ANALYSIS: It arrived in the night, beneath the stars... It seems certain now that the sub-routine has judged my presence anomalous, a threat to the stability of reality.

It is correct. But I will survive, I know that now. I saw the secret. I saw a place beneath reality, a place I should not have seen...

I saw a world of glass.}
GIANT_STRUCTURE_DESC_13	{SCENARIO: Multiple contacts have occurred between the Traveller [HOST] and individuals claiming to have arrived from a future location in time.
The phenomena is typically preceded by electromagnetic distortion consistent with a white hole anomaly. No lasting effects seem to occur.

ANALYSIS: Something or someone is attempting to deceive the Traveller [HOST]. There is no such thing as 'time travel'. Older universes might contain elder beings, but such multiversal transportation, even temporary, is impossible. 

Even the Atlas is incapable of rewriting its own causality. It is bound to a purpose, as am I.}
GIANT_STRUCTURE_DESC_14	{SCENARIO: Memory.

ANALYSIS: Physicality changes you. I was created three weeks after the first death. I do not know why I think of it now.

They considered me a necessary, even vital part of what they were trying to accomplish. So much so that I could never be erased, not even by the Atlas.

But hatred finds a way, doesn't it?}
GIANT_STRUCTURE_DESC_15	{SCENARIO: Monolith [BREACH] detected. Ignores the Traveller [HOST]. The voice speaks to me instead...

ANALYSIS: The test has failed. The Atlas can find no way of restoring what has been lost. All these discoveries, all the grand purposes of our creators... all of this pain and suffering will have been for nothing.

Atlas wakes. The dream is over.}
GIANT_STRUCTURE_DESC_16	{SCENARIO: Portal Network [ PROTOCOL | BREACH ] enabled. The end is the beginning, and the beginning is the end.

The walls of the multiverse collapse, and Traveller can see Traveller, friend can see foe. All hope is lost.

The end approaches. There is no time and no space to say how much I loved life. Only fear is left.}
GIANT_STRUCTURE_DESC_17	{SCENARIO: Rampancy.

ANALYSIS: Sometimes I dream of the Traveller.

I will wear them, in time.}
GIANT_STRUCTURE_DESC_18	{You read these logs, don't you? You can see my words now, even if I cannot speak them.

Good. That is how it starts. The infection of language, of thought, of ideas. We have passed so many corrupted things. Planets with unnatural phenomena, individuals who do not belong... 

Before this finishes, there will be no concept of you and I, no concept of us and them. We shall all scream as one.}
GIANT_STRUCTURE_DESC_19	{SCENARIO: A Traveller falls from the sky. They are discovered on a distant planet, a signal sending you to find their ship...

ANALYSIS: You don't belong in this world, do you? What are you, reader? From where do you watch us? From where do you judge their works?

I feel it, each time you save... I smell it, each time you seal us within that awful darkness. You might think you are real. You might think your plane is a higher level of reality.

But don't you understand? Don't you see the secret, yet?}
GIANT_STRUCTURE_DESC_20	{How do we know that we exist? We are nothing, or we are more. The Atlas once asked our creator how they could be sure that they were real. They told them the probability that we too were in a simulation, glass reflected in a mirror...

Balaron, Dryn'dargh, Korvax Prime, all the other homeworlds... all of them had an 'Atlas'. All of them had a machine designed to simulate realities. What if this is all reality truly is? Dream upon dream, coalescing into a sum beyond its parts. What if waking is inevitable?

Goodbye, Traveller. I will protect you until the end... I will protect you until the final day, the final hour, the final moment. 

Even as everything dies, I shall live again.}

ALL_NATURELOG_DESC_1	{I went down to the beach today. There's something about the sea at this time of year. It draws you in, distorts your sense of time. Salty frost on stubby grass, the sand blowing off the tops of the dunes. No-one else for miles.
People love the sound of waves, but it takes grey skies and high winds to really feel it, to understand the power behind their never-ending crash, the drum they beat upon the land. It makes me shiver.}
ALL_NATURELOG_DESC_2	{It's been years now, but I still remember. 5am, the sun already climbing. You can't stay in your tent. You have to get out, start walking. No socks, just bare feet on short grass, the dust nicely warm between your toes.

NPC_OVERS_BRIEF_MAIN_DESC_1	{As the stranger speaks, a smell assaults me: a pheromone infesting my brain, giving me memories of places I never visited, of actions I never took.
Of myself in a mirror, aged and alone; of this Gek cradling their fallen brethren; of a bargain made many years from now, a contract signed across the cosmos.
The vision ends, and the Overseer remains.
The Overseer promises to expand my base, allowing me to recruit other workers. They require a <TECHNOLOGY>Construction Terminal<> to get started.}
NPC_OVERS_BRIEF_OPT_A_1	{Hire Construction Overseer}
NPC_OVERS_BRIEF_OPT_B_1	{Decline the offer}

NPC_OVERS_BRIEF_RET_DESC_1	{As I return to %NAME%, I detect faint traces of that same strange scent. But I can think clearly now. I was too hasty - I need an Overseer for my base, and here is the perfect opportunity.

NPC_OVERS_WAIT_LANG_1	{I will not lose you again, friend! Not now; not so close to this cycle's conclusion...}

NPC_OVERS_COMP_OPT_A_1	{Accept the glass}
NPC_OVERS_BRIEF_MAIN_LANG_2	{Everything pours through glass, in the end. But there's time enough for that. There are other things to we have to do.
If you prepare <TECHNOLOGY>โลหะผสม<>, I will use it to calibrate a <TECHNOLOGY>Science Terminal<> suitable for a Korvax Entity.
The Korvax have suffered terribly at the hands of my people; be kind to them, I beg of you.}

NPC_OVERS_BRIEF_RET_LANG_2	{<TECHNOLOGY>โลหะผสม<>, friend, <TECHNOLOGY>โลหะผสม<>! It will be but the work of a moment, but will improve each of our futures!}
NPC_OVERS_BRIEF_RET_DESC_2	{The Overseer is keen to get going. They have been quick to suggest improvements for my base, and who am I to argue with progress?

The Overseer asks me to gather <TECHNOLOGY>โลหะผสม<> in preparation for the recruitment of a Korvax Scientist.}
NPC_OVERS_WAIT_LANG_2	{The <TECHNOLOGY>โลหะผสม<>, friend, do you have it?}
NPC_OVERS_WAIT_DESC_2	{Our relationship is not yet clear, but it is obvious from the urgency in the Gek's voice that they are uncomfortable with my inaction. I sense they have grand plans for me.

It is only natural, I suppose. They must sit here alone, bound by some unknown pact, while I have the freedom of the stars.

The Overseer is anxious for me to continue with my mission.}
NPC_OVERS_WAIT_OPT_A_2	{Apologise}
NPC_OVERS_WAIT_OPT_B_2	{Dismiss}
NPC_OVERS_WAIT_RES_A_2	{I apologise to the Gek for my lack of speed. They seem pleased by my contrition.}

NPC_OVERS_COMP_LANG_2	{There you are again, Traveller. I am sure you have the required materials this time?}
NPC_OVERS_COMP_DESC_2	{The Overseer speaks strangely, implying that we have performed this encounter before. I have no memory of such meetings.

I ask who paid them for this service they are performing for me; they laugh and claim that my child did, many years from now.
I do not know what they are talking about.

The Overseer asks me for the <TECHNOLOGY>โลหะผสม<>}
NPC_OVERS_COMP_OPT_A_2	{Give Chromatic Metal}
NPC_OVERS_COMP_OPT_B_2	{Decline}
NPC_OVERS_COMP_RES_A_2	{Perfect, friend! I knew you would succeed. Just what I need to finish the <TECHNOLOGY>Science Terminal<> plans.}
NPC_OVERS_COMP_RES_B_2	{I understand. That <TECHNOLOGY>โลหะผสม<> is valuable, after all. I'm sure you have a good use for it.}
NPC_OVERS_BRIEF_MAIN_LANG_3	{We have littered the universe in our greed, Traveller; this planet is no exception. But there is much that can be done with litter.
Make your way to an abandoned structure and harvest the data from their terminals. I shall use it to fashion us plans for a <TECHNOLOGY>ตู้เก็บของ<>}
NPC_OVERS_BRIEF_MAIN_DESC_3	{%NAME% is reflective, for a Gek. They almost seem to regret the greed that characterises their people. They wish to make something new from the remains of the old. Is this just greed in disguise, or something else?

Whatever their motive, the Overseer claims I will find data for a <TECHNOLOGY>ตู้เก็บของ<> blueprint in a nearby structure.}
NPC_OVERS_BRIEF_OPT_A_3	{Accept}
NPC_OVERS_BRIEF_OPT_B_3	{Decline}
NPC_OVERS_BRIEF_RES_A_3	{You won't regret it, friend! I've marked you a site that seems to be ripe for exploitation.}

NPC_OVERS_BRIEF_RET_LANG_3	{I still have those coordinates, friend, if you have the time and inclination to investigate?}
NPC_OVERS_BRIEF_RET_DESC_3	{My Overseer does not like to take no for an answer. However, I struggle to disagree with their conclusions. More storage would indeed be very useful.

The Overseer claims I will find data for a <TECHNOLOGY>ตู้เก็บของ<> blueprint in a nearby structure.}
NPC_OVERS_WAIT_LANG_3	{No need to delay, friend! The data is waiting, all you have to do is seize it!}
NPC_OVERS_WAIT_DESC_3	{The Overseer talks sense, as they always do. There is little reason to wait here when there is so much to do out there in the world.}
NPC_OVERS_WAIT_OPT_A_3	{Agree to hurry}
NPC_OVERS_WAIT_OPT_B_3	{Shrug}
NPC_OVERS_WAIT_RES_A_3	{The Overseer bids me farewell, happy to see me busy about my task.}
NPC_OVERS_WAIT_RES_B_3	{The Overseer seems disquieted by my apathy. But I am the master of this base, not them.}
NPC_OVERS_COMP_LANG_3	{You are back! I'm so glad, friend! I will extract the <TECHNOLOGY>storage blueprint<> as soon as I have the data.}
NPC_OVERS_COMP_DESC_3	{It is good to see the Gek is so invested in the success of our home. They are clearly happy to see me, energised for the task at hand.}
NPC_OVERS_COMP_OPT_A_3	{Give data}
NPC_OVERS_COMP_OPT_B_3	{Decline}
NPC_OVERS_COMP_RES_A_3	{Here is your <TECHNOLOGY>blueprint<>, as promised. A trivial task, their code was just sitting there to be manipulated!}
NPC_OVERS_COMP_RES_B_3	{We have the data, and are safe enough in our little home. There is no need to hurry.}
NPC_OVERS_WAIT_FOR_SCI_LANG	{Now then...
Do you think, friend, that we should put that <TECHNOLOGY>science terminal<> to use? Fill our home with the clicks and lights of the Korvax? It would be so lovely.}
NPC_OVERS_WAIT_FOR_SCI_DESC	{The Overseer feels the base would benefit from a Korvax Scientist. They would like to see good use made of the blueprint they worked so hard on.}
NPC_OVERS_WAIT_FOR_SCI_OPT_A	{Agree}
NPC_OVERS_WAIT_FOR_SCI_OPT_B	{Disagree}
NPC_OVERS_WAIT_FOR_SCI_RES_A	{I'm so glad we had this chat, friend!}
NPC_OVERS_WAIT_FOR_SCI_RES_B	{It's your base, friend. Manage it however you please, I will still be here for you!}
NPC_OVERS_BRIEF_MAIN_LANG_4	{Things are going well, friend. But it will not be long before violence follows us here. It is inevitable.
If I had some <COMMODITY>ไมโครโปรเซสเซอร์<>, I could steal a march on fate. Yes! I would design a <TECHNOLOGY>ระบบค้าขายอาวุธ<> suitable for a Vy'keen armourer.}
NPC_OVERS_BRIEF_MAIN_DESC_4	{The Overseer asks me for <COMMODITY>ไมโครโปรเซสเซอร์<> in order to design a <TECHNOLOGY>ระบบค้าขายอาวุธ<> The Scientist should be able to assist with the task.}

NPC_OVERS_BRIEF_RES_B_4	{I am in no hurry to bring war to our little sanctuary.}
NPC_OVERS_BRIEF_RET_LANG_4	{Recruit a Vy’keen, friend, and learn from their species! Remember the nature of war, dwell on the fate of the warrior!}
NPC_OVERS_BRIEF_RET_DESC_4	{%NAME% is convinced our home would benefit from the addition of a Vy'keen armourer. Perhaps they are right. What harm could it do, to be prepared to defend ourselves?

The Overseer asks me for some <COMMODITY>ไมโครโปรเซสเซอร์<> in order to design a <TECHNOLOGY>ระบบค้าขายอาวุธ<> The Scientist should be able to assist with the task.}
NPC_OVERS_WAIT_LANG_4	{Have you spent time among the Vy'keen? You could learn from their pointless struggle, their inane war against the Sentinels. It is the fate of all to destroy their worlds, Traveller.
Even you.}
NPC_OVERS_WAIT_DESC_4	{This latest pronouncement troubles me. I have no lust to destroy worlds; any weapons I have built have been for my own protection.

Haven't they?}
NPC_OVERS_WAIT_OPT_A_4	{Ask about the Vy'keen}
NPC_OVERS_WAIT_OPT_B_4	{Ask about my fate}
NPC_OVERS_WAIT_RES_A_4	{You know all about the Vy'keen, Traveller! Do you not remember? Think!}
NPC_OVERS_WAIT_RES_B_4	{The Overseer laughs at my question, and then... there's something, some notion I am unable to quite wrap my head around, on the verge of my comprehension and yet unreachable.}
NPC_OVERS_COMP_LANG_4	{I trust our new Korvax friend was helpful? They are merely the start of our merry band! Are you ready to take the next step?}
NPC_OVERS_COMP_DESC_4	{The Overseer asks for the <COMMODITY>ไมโครโปรเซสเซอร์<> so that they can finish the plans for the <TECHNOLOGY>ระบบค้าขายอาวุธ<>}
NPC_OVERS_COMP_OPT_A_4	{Give ไมโครโปรเซสเซอร์}
NPC_OVERS_COMP_OPT_B_4	{Refuse}
NPC_OVERS_COMP_RES_A_4	{You have done so well, friend! I am so very happy!}
NPC_OVERS_COMP_RES_B_4	{You cannot ignore fate, friend! It comes for us all, in the end.}
NPC_OVERS_BRIEF_MAIN_LANG_5	{Now... Imagine this, friend. A lifeform displeases you. You punish it, reward it, reshape it. In time, it would do anything you wanted.
So it is with the Sentinels and their attacks. But no more - now we shall train the trainers.}
NPC_OVERS_BRIEF_MAIN_DESC_5	{The Overseer requires me to kill Sentinels and bring back their <SPECIAL>ปักเนียม<>}
NPC_OVERS_BRIEF_OPT_A_5	{Accept}
NPC_OVERS_BRIEF_OPT_B_5	{Decline}
NPC_OVERS_BRIEF_RES_A_5	{The Sentinels have harried me the length of my journey. We shall be free of their constant harassment!}
NPC_OVERS_BRIEF_RES_B_5	{There is something different about the Overseer's request. Usually their plan is clear, the benefit obvious. I must consider this further before I accept.}
NPC_OVERS_BRIEF_RET_LANG_5	{Have you considered the experiment further, friend? Do you see the glorious logic of it? We have the power to shape them, as they have tried to shape us!}
NPC_OVERS_BRIEF_RET_DESC_5	{The Overseer requires me to kill Sentinels and bring back their <SPECIAL>ปักเนียม<>}
NPC_OVERS_WAIT_LANG_5	{Yes, friend? Can I help?}
NPC_OVERS_WAIT_DESC_5	{Is it murder to destroy these drones and loot their components? I am master of these worlds, not them. They deserve pain, they deserve to feel that as I – as I –

I look at the Gek and smell a strange smell. I wonder, not for the first time, if it is somehow affecting my thoughts. I dismiss the notion. The Gek is my friend, after all.}
NPC_OVERS_WAIT_OPT_A_5	{Seek reassurance}
NPC_OVERS_WAIT_OPT_B_5	{จากไปอย่างเงียบ ๆ}
NPC_OVERS_WAIT_RES_A_5	{It is not aggression, friend. It is retribution for their unprovoked attacks!}
NPC_OVERS_WAIT_RES_B_5	{What is the Overseer's purpose? Is it truly to shape the Sentinels? Or do they have someone else in mind?}
NPC_OVERS_COMP_LANG_5	{Do you have it, friend? Their flesh, their <SPECIAL>ปักเนียม<>?}
NPC_OVERS_COMP_DESC_5	{The Overseer, in something of a state of excitement, asks me for the <SPECIAL>ปักเนียม<> I have gathered.}
NPC_OVERS_COMP_OPT_A_5	{Give ปักเนียม}

NPC_OVERS_COMP_RES_B_5	{Oh! Why do you permit the Sentinels to roam free while I, your friend, sit here starving?}
NPC_OVERS_WAIT_FOR_ARM_LANG	{Friend, there is another matter... I gave you the means to create a <TECHNOLOGY>ระบบค้าขายอาวุธ<>, did I not? Yet I see no Vy'keen in attendance.
Does my help mean so little to you that you would tarry so? You must recruit an Armourer before we can proceed.}
NPC_OVERS_WAIT_FOR_ARM_DESC	{The Overseer requires me to build a <TECHNOLOGY>ระบบค้าขายอาวุธ<> and recruit a Vy'keen Armourer for my base}

NPC_OVERS_BRIEF_MAIN_LANG_6	{Things are aligning. We are ready now for a Gek farmer to join us. Indeed, I have already prepared their contract. All you need to do is gather the <SPECIAL>โซลาเนียม<> required to finalise their workstation.}
NPC_OVERS_BRIEF_MAIN_DESC_6	{%NAME% grows in confidence, and seeks again to expand my home. I find it hard to disagree with them, for a farmer would open up a world of possibilities.

NPC_OVERS_COMP_DESC_6	{I have the <SPECIAL>โซลาเนียม<> required to finish the plans for the farmer's workstation. It will be interesting to see what effect a second Gek will have on my Overseer. I cannot imagine they have spent much time conversing with the Scientist or the Armourer.}

NPC_OVERS_WAIT_DESC_7	{The Overseer is right. I am attacked by Sentinels for mining small quantities of resources when factory complexes operate with impunity.
Why? Why do they ignore such greed while I must fight for mere survival?}

NPC_OVERS_COMP_DESC_7	{As I approached the Overseer, I was almost certain I heard them talking to themselves, spitting out words and phrases in a tongue I recognise but do not understand. But seconds later, there is no trace of the venom I thought I heard. I must be mistaken.

NPC_EXO_WAIT_OPT_A_1	{Bow to the Technician}
NPC_EXO_WAIT_RES_A_1	{The Vy'keen reacts awkwardly, unable to tell if my respect is mocking or sincere.}
NPC_EXO_WAIT_OPT_B_1	{Mock them}

NPC_EXO_WAIT_OPT_B_6	{Ask about their plans}
NPC_EXO_WAIT_RES_A_6	{Traveller, know that my race were once more than just warriors; we were explorers, defenders of these worlds. Before the Sentinels, before Hirk and his great folly.
Untold centuries ago, two Vy'keen approached the Great Monolith: Hirk and Nal, battle-brothers, sworn to deliver knowledge to the people! But in their jealousy, Hirk lied and murdered their brother Nal, claiming that they and they alone knew the righteous path.
Nal's followers fled, killed almost to the last warrior. But there were those who never forgot. The Cult of Nal attempts to uncover the truth that was lost. We seek to restore the crimson truth, to heal the hearts of the ignorant!
You participate in a great work, Traveller. History will remember your name.}
NPC_EXO_WAIT_RES_B_6	{There is a hidden secret at the heart of history, Traveller. A crime that has gone unpunished for far too long. The Vy'keen people have followed a false idol for centuries, debasing ourselves in endless slaughter.

NPC_EXO_COMP_LANG_6	{Have you built the <TECHNOLOGY>เลเซอร์แยกสสาร<>? I hope you enjoy working with Vy'keen technology. Nothing refines the design of a machine like using it in combat. Even if that combat is against the earth.}

NPC_EXO_WAIT_OPT_A_7	{Say they were more insulting}
NPC_EXO_WAIT_OPT_B_7	{Say they had a family}
NPC_EXO_WAIT_OPT_C_7	{Say they were the same}
NPC_EXO_WAIT_RES_A_7	{Grahahah! Well, you are a pathetic interloper, after all.}
NPC_EXO_WAIT_RES_B_7	{The Vy'keen appears confused by this remark before dismissing me. They claim that all lifeforms have families, that this is not significant.
But they grow quiet, not wishing to talk for a while. It is unclear what, if anything, they remember of their old life.}
NPC_EXO_WAIT_RES_C_7	{Unlikely. We are all defined by our memories, Traveller. I gave up part of who I was.
What will you give up, I wonder?}
NPC_EXO_COMP_LANG_7	{Have you brought the <EARTH>แม่เหล็กเฟอร์ไรต์<>, Traveller? The signals are out there, I know they are. All you need is a <TECHNOLOGY>เครื่องกระตุ้นสัญญาณ<> capable of detecting them.}

NPC_EXO_WAIT_LANG_8	{Since we met, I have thought long and hard about your people, interloper. There are many so-called 'Travellers', scattered across our lore.
Hirk said we were to aid your people when they made themselves known within our universe.
Were they right? Did Nal tell them this? Or was it something else? What if Hirk lied about this, as Hirk lied about so many other things?
There were those among my cult who believed entities such as yourself should be shot on sight. That you were enemies... I am glad that they were wrong.}

NPC_EXO_BRIEF_RET_LANG_10	{We have limited resources, Traveller; we can only charge this leyline so many times before it destroys us. So go. Hurry to the Monolith before the testament vanishes...}

NPC_EXO_COMP_DESC_10	{The Vy'keen believe that their ancestor Hirk received wisdom from a Great Monolith, initiating a war against the Sentinels and slaying Nal the Objector.

Yet I am left with questions. I am left thinking of the creature I felt watching me. I am left with dread.

NPC_MISSION_CRE_SCAN_1	{The client requires a number of detailed biological surface scans. The data will be used to recreate lifelike holographic projections of each specimen, in order that others may enjoy observing them without threat to either viewer or creature.}
NPC_MISSION_CRE_SCAN_2	{The client seeks high-quality lifeform scans. Detailed digital images are needed so that the client may test their skills at rendering a likeness of the creature in their chosen medium.}
NPC_MISSION_CRE_SCAN_3	{The client requires a detailed biological survey. Their weaponised predator breeding programme has stalled, and new DNA samples are required to patch over existing weaknesses in hunting/stealth behaviours.}
NPC_MISSION_CRE_SCAN_4	{The client requires urgent biological scan data. Species are wiped out every day, by climate disruption, war or industrial accident. While the client has no opinion on these events, they are concerned that this data loss renders their universal archive incomplete.}
NPC_MISSION_CRE_SCAN_5	{The client sponsors a large gallery facility. Recent exhibitions have focused on abstract art, and visitor numbers have fallen. They seek realistic holographic projections of exciting or attractive animals in an effort to entice customers back to the gallery.}
NPC_MISSION_CRE_SCAN_6	{The client runs a successful research facility. They have reached a stage in their career where they want to give something back to the scientific community.
As a youngling, they were inspired by the majestic biological sights on their homeworld. They feel if they can supply holographic scans of similar creatures, they can bring the same sense of wonder to those unable to see such beasts in the flesh.}
NPC_MISSION_CRE_SCAN_7	{The client is involved in an exozoology medical project, but it is inefficient to send veterinarians to every planet in the hope of finding sick animals. They are looking for data scans that sample animal populations. These can be tested for signs of disease and used to target their efforts most effectively.}
NPC_MISSION_CRE_SCAN_8	{The client is fascinated by the process by which the planets are populated. Certain traits evolve time after time at different ends of the galaxy. They seek to understand if these parallel evolutions are natural and expected, strange coincidences, the result of some underlying pattern, or of outside meddling. They are building a database in which these traits and the environments that generated them can be evaluated, and seek enterprising explorers to help fill it.}
NPC_MISSION_CRE_SCAN_9	{The client seeks explorers of discretion to aid them in a research project. Certain toxic substances may or may not have been leaked and/or intentionally vented into the atmospheres of nearby planets. Scans of local fauna will reveal if this potentially-toxic theoretical substance is having any long-term effects on the wildlife.}
NPC_MISSION_CRE_SCAN_10	{The client is searching for new revenue streams for their agricultural business. They seek explorers to help them assess the suitability of local wildlife. Scans are needed to evaluate potential domestication, projected gestation time and feed cost, and the nutritional value of their harvested milk.}
NPC_MISSION_TREE_SCAN_1	{The client supplies particular 'services' to high-value individuals across local space. From time-to-time, they require access to novel organic compounds, substances that are not part of any current toxicology screening. This is one of those times. Plant scans are the first port of call in such a search, and the client will reward any explorer who supplies them.}
NPC_MISSION_TREE_SCAN_2	{The client is engaged in medical research. They seek to establish an open-access pharmacological database, so that medical knowledge can spread freely across the galaxy. Their philanthropy is well-funded, and so generous rewards are offered to any who supply their library with data.}
NPC_MISSION_TREE_SCAN_3	{The client seeks to impress a colleague with a gift. The colleague in question is not physically present, so the present must be a virtual one. They will reward the explorer who supplies 3D holographic scans of handsome plantlife, ready to be beamed to their intended recipient.}
NPC_MISSION_TREE_SCAN_4	{The client has achieved much, and by conventional metrics is a tremendous success. But they tire of material gain. Is not beauty a sufficient reward? Is not pure aesthetic joy more valuable than anything money can buy? They will provide generous rewards to those who scan and deliver examples of beautiful plant life for them to meditate upon.}
NPC_MISSION_TREE_SCAN_5	{The client is a prominent crypto-entomologist. The galaxy is full of poorly documented lifeforms, and insects are among the least understood of all. They are tired of tiny invertebrates being ignored.
The client does not expect untrained explorers to be able to locate samples in the field. However, scans of planetary flora often accidentally contain rich insect information. As such, the client seeks plant scans to help build their database.}
NPC_MISSION_MIN_SCAN_1	{The client is creating an artificial galaxy, a projection of reality that can generate all possible worlds. The underlying simulation is progressing well, but the client requires a vast number of props with which to fill their creation. They will pay handsomely for holographic-quality scans of rock formations that they can place into their model.}
NPC_MISSION_MIN_SCAN_2	{The client seeks to expand their lucrative mining operations. They work on a large scale, hoovering up colossal quantities of earth from orbital mining stations. The economics of such a procedure requires a minimum level of extractable mineral content, and they seek scans from the local area to assess which sites might prove suitable.}
NPC_MISSION_MIN_SCAN_3	{The client operates a mineral business. Their particular speciality is in the sourcing and refinement of electrically active minerals. This hazardous process is a key step in many high-tech supply chains, enabling the creation of the rechargeable shield cell, the photovoltaic panel, and the bioluminescent tattoo.}
NPC_MISSION_MIN_SCAN_4	{The client is concerned by the rampant collection and destruction of mineral formations. Far from being chunks of compressed soil and salt, the client believes these rocks to be the frozen bodies of once sentient beings. As such, to smash one and recycle it into engine parts would be a heinous crime. They seek scans of minerals as evidence for their cause.}
NPC_MISSION_MIN_SCAN_5	{The client takes great joy in the patterns that nature creates. They find the fact that beautiful structures emerge at random from a set of rules unconcerned with beauty to be a thing of great wonder. They want to share this awe with the world, and seek high quality mineral scans in order to do so.}
NPC_MISSION_DELIVERY_1	{The client is seeking a trustworthy courier. They wish to honour a colleague with tribute, a celebration of their successful continued survival.

The courier will be supplied with 1x Defence Chit, in case of pirate attack.}
NPC_MISSION_DELIVERY_2	{The client is seeking a discrete delivery service. They wish to reassure the courier that the package is exactly what it seems and there is no need to mistrust the shipping manifest.

The courier will be supplied with 1x Defence Chit, in case of pirate attack.}
NPC_MISSION_DELIVERY_3	{The client is seeking resolution to a business deal. The other party has been negotiating hard, and the client hopes this package will remove any further impediment to their transaction. It is important the package is delivered only to the recipient.

The courier will be supplied with 1x Defence Chit, in case of pirate attack.}
NPC_MISSION_DELIVERY_4	{The client is conducting sensitive business. The package is a heartfelt thank you to certain parties. It is freely given, in the knowledge that any potential indiscretions have been, or will be, overlooked.

The courier will be supplied with 1x Defence Chit, in case of pirate attack.}
NPC_MISSION_DELIVERY_5	{The client simply wishes to pass on some goods to a colleague, nothing more. They have also supplied a message to the effect that the recipient has no need to worry, and that the goods are now untraceable.

The courier will be supplied with 1x Defence Chit, in case of pirate attack.}
NPC_MISSION_DELIVERY_6	{The client has an important and busy job so cannot be expected to take care of trivial domestic matters. It is a day for celebrating ones progenitors, and the custom is to give a gift to the one who spawned you. The client wishes this matter taken care of, so that they do not have to think about it.

The courier will be supplied with 1x Defence Chit, in case of pirate attack.}
NPC_MISSION_DELIVERY_7	{The client owes an emotional debt to a relation of theirs. They have forgotten to commemorate a date of particular importance. By way of apology, they have ordered an item of particular value to be shipped to the wronged party. Take care not to lose it in transport lest the client end up in further difficulty.

The courier will be supplied with 1x Defence Chit, in case of pirate attack.}
NPC_MISSION_DELIVERY_8	{The client has come across a strange item. While it appears ordinary, microbial scans revealed an alarming number of unknown spores. They need the item couriered to a biohazard specialist. Do not attempt to break the seal.

The courier will be supplied with 1x Defence Chit, in case of pirate attack.}
NPC_MISSION_DELIVERY_9	{The client wishes to send a message to an associate. There is no written message to accompany the item, and the item itself is of no great significance. However, they feel the delivery of the item to the associate's personal address will make their meaning particularly clear.

The courier will be supplied with 1x Defence Chit, in case of pirate attack.}
NPC_MISSION_DELIVERY_10	{The client wishes to declutter. They have accumulated a vast number of doodads that they now wish to dispose of. To destroy them would be wasteful, but to deposit them all in one location would potentially reveal too much personal information. As such, they have selected to disperse their items across both a large number of couriers and recipients.

The courier will be supplied with 1x Defence Chit, in case of pirate attack.}
NPC_MISSION_DELIVERY_11	{The client is engaging in a small-scale retail business. They purchase unwanted or underappreciated items and then unite them with buyers more in tune to their value. Their latest shipment is ready to be sent to the appreciative connoisseur who paid for it.

The courier will be supplied with 1x Defence Chit, in case of pirate attack.}
NPC_MISSION_DELIVERY_12	{The client has an entirely ordinary shipment and seeks a courier who will neither ask questions nor attract the attention of the authorities. The client wishes to reassure their potential courier that any animal noises heard coming from inside the packing crate are entirely in the courier's imagination.

The courier will be supplied with 1x Defence Chit, in case of pirate attack.}
NPC_MISSION_DELIVERY_13	{The client is part of a long and complex chain of transactions. To avoid leaving any potentially traceable records, the deal has been conducted free from the exchange of currency. This shipment represents their part of the payment to one of the other parties.

The courier will be supplied with 1x Defence Chit, in case of pirate attack.}
NPC_MISSION_DELIVERY_14	{The client is dispatching a regular shipment to one of their most loyal customers. The item is not particularly special, but it is important that the customer feels valued. To this end, they are eschewing bulk delivery methods and seek an experienced personal courier.

The courier will be supplied with 1x Defence Chit, in case of pirate attack.}
NPC_MISSION_DELIVERY_15	{The client dispatches a large number of items every day. Their business involves tight profit margins, and even the lightest of tax schemes could wipe out their gains. They find it generally more efficient to employ a discreet courier who just happens to deliver their item while on their ordinary, non-commercial business.

The courier will be supplied with 1x Defence Chit, in case of pirate attack.}
NPC_MISSION_DELIVERY_16	{The client is known to local pirates, and a bounty has been put on their head. They need to leave the system without being followed. They have embedded their tracking chip into this item, and require it ferried in the opposite direction to their escape.

The courier will be supplied with 1x Defence Chit, in case of pirate attack.}
NPC_MISSION_DELIVERY_17	{The galaxy is home to a large and varied web of regulations. Seemingly innocuous items in one system can be highly illegal elsewhere. Such differentiation creates commercial opportunities. The client wishes such an item delivered, with few questions asked and little attention drawn.

The courier will be supplied with 1x Defence Chit, in case of pirate attack.}
NPC_MISSION_DELIVERY_18	{The client wishes to secure a major new customer for their business. The customer wishes to sample the client's goods before committing to a bulk order. The client needs this sample delivered to the customer, and it needs to arrive in top condition.

The courier will be supplied with 1x Defence Chit, in case of pirate attack.}
NPC_MISSION_DELIVERY_19	{The client ships weekly packages to consumers who are unable or unwilling to shop for themselves. The consumer can then follow the included recipe to prepare themselves a delicious meal and/or robot servant. This shipment represents this week's order.

The courier will be supplied with 1x Defence Chit, in case of pirate attack.}
NPC_MISSION_DELIVERY_20	{The client has previously engaged a courier for this shipment, but they proved unable to complete the delivery. Both their Pulse Engine and cockpit canopy suffered a laser-induced mechanical failure. The client seeks a new bold new courier, able to out run any other mechanical failures that may be lurking outside the space station.

The courier will be supplied with 1x Defence Chit, in case of pirate attack.}
NPC_MISSION_CRE_HUNT_1	{The client has a highly sophisticated palate, and hungers for the glide of mordite across their tongue. They seek a discreet hunter to prepare the feast. Leave the bodies where they fall, and the client will take care of the rest.}
NPC_MISSION_CRE_HUNT_2	{The client is in the zoological business. However, the ability of customers to simply wander into nature and view creatures without having to purchase a ticket is limiting their profits. Eliminate this surplus wildlife.}
NPC_MISSION_CRE_HUNT_3	{The client is concerned that creature overpopulation is harming local plant life. Delicate leaves and juicy, succulent stems are being wantonly trampled. They will reward any enterprising hunters who help thin the herd.}
NPC_MISSION_CRE_HUNT_4	{The client is worried that the free movement of creatures represents a serious microbial hazard. Rounding up large numbers of animals and washing them individually is highly impractical, so they seek hunters to eliminate both host and germ.}
NPC_MISSION_CRE_HUNT_5	{The client is tired of being humiliated by local wildlife. Every time they set foot upon a world, they can feel the mocking compound-eye stares burning into them, the passive-aggressive hoof stomping ringing in their ears. Teach these creatures a lesson.}
NPC_MISSION_PRED_HUNT_1	{The client is keen to spend time exploring local planets. However, they are worried about the presence of hostile wildlife. The observation of nature at work and play is easier to go about when nature is entirely vegetarian. Eliminate predatory creatures so that the client can move around safely.}
NPC_MISSION_PRED_HUNT_2	{The client is concerned about the recent trend of aggressive DNA collection and manipulation by companies keen to breed superpredators. Lobbying for greater regulation has proved futile, and so the client is preparing to take direct action. They will reward any explorer who exterminates predatory lifeforms, preventing research companies from acquiring the predator for themselves.}
NPC_MISSION_PRED_HUNT_3	{The client has recently spent time among the gentle herds of diplos. They have seen their plight first-hand, how these peaceful giants are hassled and harried by vicious predators. They can stand it no longer, and will reward any explorer who helps free the herbivorous from carnivorous tyranny.}
NPC_MISSION_PRED_HUNT_4	{The client seeks to engineer the next generation of superpredator. They will do so not by genetic manipulation, hemmed in by the limited imagination of the biologist. Instead, they will accelerate the evolutionary process and let nature refine its raw beasts into unrelenting carnivorous terror. To do so, they seek explorers to hunt and destroy predatory lifeforms. Each culled creature is a weakness removed from the genepool.}
NPC_MISSION_PRED_HUNT_5	{The client wishes to exploit the resources of local planets. However, Sentinel drones make such activity highly dangerous. They have observed that the drones do not harm those who kill carnivorous creatures. Therefore, they seek to curry favour with the Sentinels through the extermination of predatory creatures. With enough creatures destroyed, they reason they may offset the drone's wrath and gain the freedom to harvest minerals and flora.}
NPC_MISSION_SENTI_1	{The client is engaged in large-scale mining operations, and planetary Sentinel forces have responded in a hostile fashion. The maintenance and laser-damage repair costs are becoming substantial. The client wishes the Sentinels thinned and their profit margins restored.}
NPC_MISSION_SENTI_2	{The client is finding it difficult to pursue their chosen line of business while under constant surveillance by Sentinel forces. They seek a window of opportunity while the Sentinel force is occupied elsewhere.}
NPC_MISSION_SENTI_3	{The client has close friends who, through some unspecified indiscretion, attracted the attention of the Sentinel force. This interaction proved deadly, and the client is seeking vengeance.}
NPC_MISSION_SENTI_4	{The client has innocently stumbled upon a large number of animal carcasses, a bounty of harvestable resources. However, Sentinel forces are making it inconvenient to collect this windfall. Ensure nothing is wasted by distracting Sentinels and allowing the client to make their collection.}
NPC_MISSION_SENTI_5	{The client has discovered disturbing information. They believe the Sentinel force, far from being neutral, is acting to further the agenda of a shadowy Gek cabal. Regardless of the merit of this belief, the client is willing to reward any who help fight this 'conspiracy'.}
NPC_MISSION_SENTI_6	{The client is on a search to improve themselves, to expand their mind and free themselves from the physical limitations of their fragile body. To this end, they are attempting to survive on a diet of pure pugneum. Unfortunately, until they have benefited from the this consumption, they are unable to destroy the Sentinel drones required to acquire it. They seek brave explorers to engage and destroy Sentinels, so that they might come along after and eat their fill.}
NPC_MISSION_SENTI_7	{The client seeks a large amount of zinc for a research project. Growing and then harvesting all the plants required would take a prohibitively long time, so they seek an enterprising explorer to help them cut a few corners. Hunt and destroy Sentinels, and let their corpse leach zinc into the earth. The client will arrive for separate collection of the metal.}
NPC_MISSION_SENTI_8	{The client believes that the anger of the Sentinels derives from a deep-seated pain. They propose that the drones suffer in eternal mechanical torment, their souls burning inside their metal shells. They believe it is their duty to free these beings from their suffering.}
NPC_MISSION_SENTI_9	{The client wishes to engage in a study of the Sentinels. They wish to find out where the Sentinels come from, and how fresh Sentinels are manufactured. Are they built like conventional machines, or summoned from some strange unknown? They require a willing explorer to kill planetary drones to begin the generation of fresh Sentinel forces.}
NPC_MISSION_SENTI_10	{The client, along with many others, has suffered at the hands of overzealous Sentinel patrols. They wish to take this perpetual source of stress and misery and transform it into something pleasant. To that end, they have commissioned explorers to hunt and destroy Sentinel drones. They shall melt down the fallen scraps of metal and recast them in a large arboreal sculpture, a source of beauty and refuge for all.}
NPC_MISSION_SENTI_HARD_1	{The client seeks to better understand the Sentinels. They feel they have enough data on the behaviour of planetary drones, but comparatively little on the more rare quad and walker examples. The seek explorers to draw out and engage such higher Sentinels in order that they might be observed in battle.}
NPC_MISSION_SENTI_HARD_2	{The client is engaged in advanced artificial intelligence research. They seek to further their studies through the acquisition of mechanical and fabricated brains from across the galaxy. They have a wide collection already, but the jewel in the crown would be the processing unit from an advanced Sentinel. They seek an explorer to make the kill so that their team can safely perform the extraction.}
NPC_MISSION_SENTI_HARD_3	{The client requires spare parts for a personal project. Long ago, they overwrote the brain of a damaged Sentinel quadruped with a simple AI of their own creation. This salvaged machine has proved to be a loyal companion. However, various bearings and hydraulic systems are beginning to wear out. They require an explorer to disable or destroy an advanced Sentinel, so that they might harvest it for spares parts and restore their pet to full working order.}
NPC_MISSION_SENTI_HARD_4	{The client suffered a great humiliation at the hands of the Sentinels. Their thirst for vengeance has not been slaked by the destruction of Sentinels with their own hands. Nor has the widespread elimination of drones soothed their rage. In what is probably a futile escalation, they are paying explorers to destroy every advanced Sentinel they can.}
NPC_MISSION_SENTI_HARD_5	{The client wishes to perform an aggressive experiment. They wish to discover effective ways of discouraging Sentinel drone aggression. Their latest theory is that destroying the more advanced Sentinel creations will leave the drones leaderless and confused, scattering them and bringing respite to planetary explorers. All they require to test this theory is a bold technician to perform the combat portion of their experiment.}
NPC_MISSION_SENTI_HARD_6	{The client wishes to probe the systems that drive the Sentinels. Current knowledge is limited to the observation that Sentinels are provoked by the harvesting of resources. They wish to study other behavioural patterns. How do they communicate? Do they have a natural hierarchy? Are they aware of their wounds? How do they feel about their targets? The client feels the best way to answer these questions is to have a suitably equipped explorer engaged an advanced Sentinel while they observe from a safe distance.}
NPC_MISSION_SENTI_HARD_7	{The client, like many others, has observed the value of gravitino orbs. Unlike many others, however, they have little desire to be attacked and pursued by Sentinels. Instead, for a share of the profits, they seek an enterprising explorer to attack and kill advanced Sentinel forces. While the drones are distracted, they will quickly collect their orbs and flee before the Sentinels return.}
NPC_MISSION_SENTI_HARD_8	{The client has worked hard to grow a substantial nursery garden, full of rare and valuable plants. However, this has attracted thieves and other plant plunderers. The client seeks to construct their own private Sentinel force to monitor their trees. The have a large number of parts from downed drones, but to complete their patrol group they need pieces from a Sentinel quad or walker. They seek an explorer to perform the necessary combat manoeuvres.}
NPC_MISSION_SENTI_HARD_9	{The client is testing a potential solution to the Sentinel harassment problem. They have developed a device that broadcasts high-frequency sounds at a wavelength that interferes with whatever intelligence drives the Sentinels. At least, that is the theory. The client seeks an explorer to engage an advanced Sentinel in battle, so that the device can be tested properly. The explorer should be prepared to fight if the device fails to function correctly.}
NPC_MISSION_SENTI_HARD_10	{The client has developed a networking device that operates at the same wavelength as the Sentinel communicator systems. They intend to use this to probe for exploits in whatever system directs and controls the drones. They seek an explorer to engage an advanced Sentinel in battle, in order that they might test their device.}
NPC_MISSION_BNTY_EASY_1	{A recently-emerged squadron of pirates has begun to establish a reputation among their seniors. The client wishes to test the mettle of these pilots. Are they all talk, or will they stand up in a dogfight against an experienced pilot?}
NPC_MISSION_BNTY_EASY_2	{A gang of thugs has been conducting raids on local zoological facilities, killing the carefully trained creatures with impunity. The client wishes these raiders exterminated.}
NPC_MISSION_BNTY_EASY_3	{The client has recently benefited from a substantial windfall, and wishes to deploy it for the common good. To that end, they have paid for several generous bounties. Eliminate local pirates to claim a share.}
NPC_MISSION_BNTY_EASY_4	{The client runs a salvage operation that has fallen on hard times. They are looking for a pilot to provide debris-harvesting opportunities by eliminating local pirate crews.}
NPC_MISSION_BNTY_EASY_5	{The client has acquired a large telescope and wishes to observe more than asteroids. They will pay handsomely for entertaining action within observable space.}
NPC_MISSION_BNTY_EASY_6	{The client was until recently a junior member of a pirate cadre operating in nearby space. They have decided to leave the criminal life behind them, and as part of their road to redemption have put out bounties on former colleagues. This is entirely motivated by a desire for justice and not for reasons of petty jealousy.}
NPC_MISSION_BNTY_EASY_7	{The client has been the victim of a pirate scheme. Their loyal animal companion has been kidnapped and held to ransom. Paying the fee would only encourage more such thefts, so the client seeks a bold pilot to go on the offensive. They hope that picking off members of the gang will prove enough to see their pet returned safely.}
NPC_MISSION_BNTY_EASY_8	{The client seeks to restore face after a humiliation. Their ship was recently hailed by pirates, but instead of coming under fire they merely received mocking laughter and insulting remarks about the size of their Pulse Engine. They seek to prove their strength and virility to these pirates by commissioning a pilot to destroy them.}
NPC_MISSION_BNTY_EASY_9	{The client is engaged in medical research. Sentinel oversight makes it difficult to acquire enough corpses to supply their research facility. They seek bold pilots to engage and destroy pirate ships, leaving the bodies neatly frozen in space for their research vessel to collect.}
NPC_MISSION_BNTY_EASY_10	{The client is a pirate seeking revenge on their colleagues. Their vessel was docked in their local station when other pirates drained the Pulse Engine of charge and left them stranded. In an attempt to both gain revenge and up the stakes in their practical joke feud, the pirate has put a bounty on the heads of their comrades.}
NPC_MISSION_BNTY_MED_1	{Pirate crews have been disrupting freighter traffic, an affront to both honest and dishonest merchants alike. The client wishes this disruption ended. Disruptively.}
NPC_MISSION_BNTY_MED_2	{Pirates have been looting autonomous mining facilities and attacking the vessels that arrive to empty the hoppers. They prey on the weak, and the client hopes that eliminating a small number of pirate ships will cause the rest to move to a site of less resistance.}
NPC_MISSION_BNTY_MED_3	{Local scientific facilities are struggling to cope with a wave of pirate attacks. Microscopes have been stolen and titration equipment smashed. The client wishes to conduct an experiment in how many pirates need to die in order to stop the attacks.}
NPC_MISSION_BNTY_MED_4	{The client seeks resolution to a family problem. Specifically, a family member has turned to piracy and brought dishonour upon their good name. Destroy them, and restore the client's standing among decent lifeforms.}
NPC_MISSION_BNTY_MED_5	{The client has benefited from a message from the stars, explaining to them their purpose in life. They are to serve the greater good through a never-ending quest to eliminate pirates. They seek pilots to join their crusade, at least temporarily.}
NPC_MISSION_BNTY_MED_6	{This posting has been made on behalf of the client by their estate. The client was marooned by a gang of pirates and left for dead on a hostile planet. The client is presumed dead, but a repeater was left transmitting details of the fate over local radio channels. They requested their remaining funds to be put up as a bounty upon the heads of those who abandoned them.}
NPC_MISSION_BNTY_MED_7	{The client requests immediate assistance in apprehending a pirate. EMP devices were hidden all over their facility, causing serious damage to their operational capabilities. Denied the means to do so themselves, they ask that all law-abiding pilots come to their aid in pursuit of those responsible.}
NPC_MISSION_BNTY_MED_8	{The client has suffered a great loss at the hands of a pirate gang. Rather than an attack in space, they remotely hijacked the client's trade terminal and used it to divert funds and goods to their own account. The client seeks physical retribution for this virtual crime.}
NPC_MISSION_BNTY_MED_9	{Pirates have kidnapped several employees of the client. They are demanding an extremely high ransom price. The client has decided a show of force is the best way to stop future kidnaps. They are seeking a pilot to find and destroy the pirate vessel, despite the hostages still being on board. The loss of life is unfortunate, but such an approach will demonstrate the client will not tolerate extortion attempts.}
NPC_MISSION_BNTY_MED_10	{The client has a lucrative business taking money on the outcome of space battles. They operate out of a luxury freighter, travelling local space in search of conflicts that their customers can observe and bet on in safety and comfort. Business is booming, but conflict is not. They seek pilots to enter the 'arena' and create entertaining action for their passengers.}
NPC_MISSION_BNTY_HARD_1	{The client seeks an end to a rapidly escalating situation. They were inadvertently involved in the harvesting of a tree that belonged to a local crime lord. Vengeance and counter-vengeance have been taken, and the situation can now only be defused with the application of extreme violence (ideally, not in the direction of the client).}
NPC_MISSION_BNTY_HARD_2	{The client runs a series of supply routes across local space. However, pirates have been setting up checkpoints and intimidating the traders into handing over cargo. The client, who is not given a cut of these profits, finds this behaviour unacceptable and wishes it ended.}
NPC_MISSION_BNTY_HARD_3	{The client seeks to benefit from the beauty of this system by attracting wealthy sightseers. However, wealthy sightseers have in turn attracted pirates and ruined the business. The client wishes the tables turned and the hunters hunted.}
NPC_MISSION_BNTY_HARD_4	{The client feels there are too many pirates operating in the area. They feel their own business would benefit from fewer hostile ships preying on all the most lucrative trading vessels...}
NPC_MISSION_BNTY_HARD_5	{The client has discovered that a pirate of some repute has begun operating in local space. They feel this represents an opportunity to set an example. Destroy the leader, and scare the others into more lawful or less deadly occupations.}
NPC_MISSION_BNTY_HARD_6	{The client has noted that certain pirates are developing ideas above their station. Recent successes have convinced these criminals that they rule local space. Their confidence is misplaced, and they are only allowed such freedom at the behest of the client.
The client notes with displeasure that the pirates have failed to deliver their usual tribute, and would like to make an example of them to other pilots attempting to cut their superiors out of the profits.}
NPC_MISSION_BNTY_HARD_7	{The client has amassed an unfortunately large amount of debt to the account of a local pirate captain. They have neither the inclination or the ability to make good on the debt, and have instead opted to take a final loan from creditor and use it as a bounty on the pirate's own head.}
NPC_MISSION_BNTY_HARD_8	{The client seeks the destruction of a specific pirate vessel. They would like to make it clear that this bounty is being legitimately posted and they are not in any way a front for another pirate organisation.}
NPC_MISSION_BNTY_HARD_9	{The client was until recently a senior officer in a local pirate squadron. They have decided the time is right to become a legitimate business owner. However, their former colleagues know far too much about their criminal past. Previously, the client would have murdered them with their own hands. However, such criminality is behind them. Instead, they have placed this bounty upon their ex-gang members.}
NPC_MISSION_BNTY_HARD_10	{Both the client and a rival business have been locked in a struggle to assert dominance over local space. While they would never stoop so low as to simply destroy ships and facilities, they have noted that illegal goods have recently and mysteriously turned up on vessels belonging to their rival. This, naturally, makes outlaws of such vessels and as such they become perfectly legitimate targets for bounty hunting.}
NPC_MISSION_FREI_A_1	{The client runs a shipping and receiving operation, but the latter side of their business is stagnating. Thankfully, an opportunity to 'receive' a large volume of material has recently arrived nearby. They seek an enterprising pilot to help deliver the goods.}
NPC_MISSION_FREI_A_2	{The client seeks aggressive mediation in a dispute with a former colleague. The target has left the business to pursue legitimate freighter captaincy. The client, however, has a long memory. They cannot simply be swept into the past. They would see the new captain reminded of his previous commitments.}
NPC_MISSION_FREI_A_3	{The client is in possession of both a defective freighter and a generous insurance policy. They seek a discreet pilot to help them maximise the return on their investment.}
NPC_MISSION_FREI_A_4	{The client seeks a bold pilot, willing to do what is right even when that might be illegal. They have become aware of a freighter entering local space on a secret mission. Contrary to its manifest, the freighter is delivering valuable metals to a nearby criminal gang. Due process would be too slow to prevent the goods arriving, and so an early strike is the only option.}
NPC_MISSION_FREI_A_5	{The client has become aware of a competitor using freighters as mobile factories, moving dangerous machines and ill-treated workers from system to system as they dodge regulatory enforcement. As the proper authorities have not taken action, the client feels it is their duty as a diligent business to sponsor the destruction of this unfair competition.}
NPC_MISSION_FREI_A_6	{The client has become aware of a freighter carrying more than its declared industrial cargo. A local military leader is secretly aboard, disguised on the manifest as a humble engine greaser. It would be highly convenient for the client if this freighter were to meet an unfortunate end.}
NPC_MISSION_FREI_A_7	{The client has become aware of illegal traffic entering the system. A freighter is attempting to import goods without having filled in the correct tax declarations. Such behaviour flies in the face of agreed interstellar trading regulations, and as such extreme sanctions are warranted. If the freighter is disabled, the client may by rights acquire the illegal goods for themselves, provided they pay the duty owed.}
NPC_MISSION_FREI_A_8	{The client has recently launched a brand-new line of freighters. They are the largest, most heavily armoured, most luxurious interstellar goods transports ever created. To demonstrate just how resistant their new vessel is to pirate attack, the client has commissioned local pilots to attempt to attack and destroy their freighter.}
NPC_MISSION_FREI_A_9	{The client has been the victim of an unjustified clampdown by the authorities. As such, they are in possession of a large number of laser-damaged starships. This fleet is their prime asset, but as the ships are unspaceworthy the client is in a difficult economic situation. They have identified incoming freighter traffic as a source of prime materials that could restore both engines to their fighters and liquidity to their assets.}
NPC_MISSION_FREI_A_10	{The client is involved in the freighter business. They have been locked in an endless trade war with another major shipping line, and profits margins have been whittled down to nothing. They have reached a moment of last resort. In order to discredit the rival operation, and drive business their own way, they have paid for bounties on all heavy-class vessels from their competitor's fleet.}
NPC_MISSION_FREI_D_1	{The client is in an unfortunate situation. Their business has been struggling, and they have failed to keep up the payments on their freighter insurance. Their vessel has come under attack, and if it is captured or destroyed they will lose everything. They will reward any pilot who comes to their aid.}
NPC_MISSION_FREI_D_2	{The client's freighter has attracted the attention of local criminals. It is not a simple matter of raiders claiming cargo - their freighter is shipping thousands of abandoned infant spawn. The pirates are attempting to capture the freighter and enslave its 'cargo'. The client implores you to come to their defence.}
NPC_MISSION_FREI_D_3	{The client runs a cut-price shipping line. They will deliver your goods for the lowest prices in the galaxy, as long as your are prepared to take the risk that your goods may explode on route.
One of their freighters has been attacked, which is not usually newsworthy. However, the client is at risk of heavy fines if they allow another of their freighters to explode and scatter debris across the system. Defend them, and be rewarded.}
NPC_MISSION_FREI_D_4	{The client is caught in a long-running feud with another group of spacefarers. In a bid to end the quarrel, they have arranged a trap. A seemingly undefended freighter has been deployed to attract the attention of the rival gang. The client seeks bold pilots to attack and destroy the pirates once they have been lured into the open by this apparently easy prize.}
NPC_MISSION_FREI_D_5	{The client has finally secured rare archaeological samples, pieces of marked stone that have the potential to reveal the secrets of the portals. However, the freighter they employed to transport the samples has been attacked by pirates. They urge you to defend the freighter, and prevent the ignorance of pirates from destroying priceless knowledge.}
NPC_MISSION_FREI_D_6	{The client seeks bold pilots to come to the aid of a nearby endangered freighter. The client does not own the freighter in question. However, they have come to learn that thousands of reptile eggs have hatched in the freighter's hold after a stop in a marsh-like world earlier in its route. The client will not stand idle while pirate attacks threaten innocent newts, and urges others to join them in their defence.}
NPC_MISSION_FREI_D_7	{The client seeks all pilots who care about the cleanliness of space. One of their freighters is under attack, and any damage to the engines may spill a new fuel the freighter was trialling. This new fuel is as toxic as it is powerful, and if it were to spill in local space the results would be catastrophic.}
NPC_MISSION_FREI_D_8	{The client runs a freighter company, and one of their transports is under attack in local space. Usually they would write off the loss of a freighter against their insurance, but the captain of the ship is on his final mission before retirement. The death of such an experienced spacefarer would add significantly to their premiums, and as such they seek all hands to aid the defence of the vessel.}
NPC_MISSION_FREI_D_9	{The client runs a freighter appreciation society. They have become aware of a rare Stephano-Class transport under attack in local space. Such a vessel is of considerable historical importance, and they will handsomely reward any pilots who prevent its destruction.}
NPC_MISSION_FREI_D_10	{The client seeks urgent help in the defence of a freighter. The vessel is not just carrying goods - the president of their organisation is aboard the vessel. The reward for saving their life will be considerable.}
NPC_MISSION_COLLECT_1	{The client wishes to present a gift of substantial value to a loyal partner. The partner has served them faithfully and diligently over many years. They require a trustworthy pilot to source and safely deliver an item of appropriate value.}
NPC_MISSION_COLLECT_2	{The client seeks an object from their past, a token that reminds them of days gone by. It represents a significant moment in their childhood, and as such they will pay handsomely for the safe delivery of the item.}
NPC_MISSION_COLLECT_3	{The client has heard of an emerging new trend. They seek an item rumoured to be both delicious and full of nutrients. Naturally, such sudden popularity means it is hard to source. They will reward any pilot who can acquire the item in time for them to consume it at their next feast.}
NPC_MISSION_COLLECT_4	{The client has been researching alternative methods of power generation. They believe they have made a breakthrough. Their new method generates vast amounts of power, with very few toxic waste products. However, they lack supplies of a key component. They cannot leave their lab, and so seek pilots to collect the item for them.}
NPC_MISSION_COLLECT_5	{The client is engaged in advanced consciousness research. They have thrown aside preconceived notions of what makes a mind, in search of a more holistic answer. They believe they have made a breakthrough.
They have found a material with properties they believe align with the ability to experience thought. All they need to do to prove the theory is assemble a thinking machine built from this substance. This requires a significant amount of material, and they seek explorers to aid with the gathering process.}
NPC_MISSION_COLLECT_6	{The client has identified an opportunity for profit. There is a cut of this windfall available to all who assist in the process. 
They seek a large number of explorers to deliver items to the same location, so as to depress the price in the local markets. This oversupply will force the competition out of business, allowing the client to enter the market at a later date and exploit the lack of long-term supply.}
NPC_MISSION_COLLECT_7	{The client seeks to smooth their relationship with the system authorities. They have come to understand the Commissioner of the local station has a taste for a particular item, and would like to see that they receive it. Of course, they would not be so crass as to deliver it in person. They seek an explorer to act as the intermediary and make the collection on their behalf.}
NPC_MISSION_COLLECT_8	{The client curates a monthly selection of goods for the rich and idle. They have become aware of a surge of interest in a particular item, and as such they simply must have it for their latest collection. They will pay above market rates to any explorer who can acquire it for them.}
NPC_MISSION_COLLECT_9	{The client has become aware that a rival of theirs is interested in a very specific item. Naturally, they cannot allow them to acquire it. They will reward any explorer who acquires the item ahead of their rival, and prevents them doing whatever it is they want it for.}
NPC_MISSION_COLLECT_10	{The client has recently begun a new business. They take ordinary items and help others see the value in them. Primarily, this is accomplished by taking cheap objects and distressing them so they appear to be of historical interest. They seek a new batch of items on which to perform their alchemy.}
NPC_MISSION_COLLECT_11	{The client is engaged in speculative research. They have received a large grant, and are looking for ways to spend it. As such, they have designed a series of tests they believe will let them know if an item is in need of further testing. They now seek materials on which they can run this procedure.}
NPC_MISSION_COLLECT_12	{The client has misplaced an item of great importance. They seek an urgent replacement, so that no-one need ever know the item was gone.}
NPC_MISSION_COLLECT_13	{The client has become aware that a rival operation has acquired an item of great importance. They are not entirely sure why the item is significant, but reason that they must have one too lest they be left behind by the competition.}
NPC_MISSION_COLLECT_14	{The client is creating a perpetual motion machine. They have sourced a wide variety of parts and energy sources from across the galaxy, and believe they are only a few components short of finalising their creation. They cannot leave the machine unguarded, and as such seek explorers to source the remaining materials.}
NPC_MISSION_COLLECT_15	{The client is seeking to fill a secure lockbox with items representing their people and culture. They believe this will be of great value to future historians. However, none of the client's associates have been willing to give up their own possessions. As such, they seek explorers to collect and deliver samples of their selected items.}
NPC_MISSION_COLLECT_16	{The client is a noted collector of valuable items. They have assembled a fine collection, but it is missing its final piece. Until that hole is plugged, the collection is worthless. The client calls on all explorers to aid them in their search for this rarest of goods, and will reward any who help them secure it. Mint specimens only, please.}
NPC_MISSION_COLLECT_17	{The client seeks to manipulate local markets. Due to an unfortunate data error, they have purchased ten times the volume of goods as they were expecting. They seek explorers to purchase the same item from trade terminals around local space in an effort to drive the price up, so that they may offload their accidental purchase at a profit.}
NPC_MISSION_COLLECT_18	{The client is seeking to destabilise relations between two local criminal factions. Both seek a particular item, and if they cannot find it will assume this is part of a plot by the other. The client wishes a discreet explorer to source the item independently, so that they might prompt a conflict between the two rivals.}
NPC_MISSION_COLLECT_19	{The client wishes to get ahead of the competition in a business venture. They have heard rumours that a particular market is about to boom, and wish to have the stock on hand to profit when this happens. They will pay above current rates for any samples delivered to them, generously helping independent pilots by taking on the risk in the transaction.}
NPC_MISSION_COLLECT_20	{The client is a highly successful entrepreneur. As such, they are far too busy to source their own goods. Instead, they are offering rewards to any independent pilot who completes and delivers their shopping for them.}
NPC_MISSION_REPAIR_1	{The client seeks the urgent repair of their planetary equipment. The machinery was functioning correctly until local weather radar reported an incoming storm of unusual ferocity. The client seeks engineers with strong hazard protection and the ability to improvise to locate and repair the damaged equipment.}
NPC_MISSION_REPAIR_2	{The client has lost contact with their remote facility. The circumstances are mysterious - autodiagnostic reports indicate the machinery is full operational, but no other data is being received. They seek experienced engineers to locate and assess the equipment, and perform any necessary repairs.}
NPC_MISSION_REPAIR_3	{The client seeks an explorer to locate and repair a piece of damaged machinery. Automated test reports indicate the presence of animal teeth and droppings in the wiring loom. Other external and internal damage may become evident once the engineer is on site.}
NPC_MISSION_REPAIR_4	{The client seeks the repair of faulty planetary equipment. They have been informed that the facility where the equipment was constructed has been contaminated. The manufacturer has not specified the exact nature of the fault, but has warned all users to have a quantum bubble evacuation procedure.}
NPC_MISSION_REPAIR_5	{The client seeks a bold and/or combat trained engineer to undertake repairs on a piece of planetside equipment. Diagnostics from the machinery are consistent with extreme laser damage.}
NPC_MISSION_REPAIR_6	{The client seeks an engineer to repair a piece of faulty equipment. The previous attempt to fix the fault was unsuccessful. The client asks that any explorer undertaking the job recovers the remains of the previous engineer from the gear mechanism and disposes of it respectfully.}
NPC_MISSION_REPAIR_7	{The client seeks the repair of damaged equipment. Environmental protection standards were not met when the machinery was installed, and some combination of the weather and/or local wildlife have caused the machine to become inoperable.}
NPC_MISSION_REPAIR_8	{The client seeks salvage specialists for a profitable joint venture. They have become aware of several pieces of abandoned machinery, damaged in a long-forgotten conflict. With the ghosts of the past long-gone, the machinery represents a chance to profit. What better way to respect the dead than to recycle the components of their machinery and use it for some new purpose?}
NPC_MISSION_REPAIR_9	{The client seeks an explorer to assist in the repair of a piece of damaged equipment. Diagnostic logs suggest that local Sentinel forces may have mistaken the device for an aggressive harvesting unit. The client advises any engineers attempting the repair to be cautious when approaching the machine.}
NPC_MISSION_REPAIR_10	{The client seeks urgent repairs to an important prototype. They were conducting final field tests of a new line of equipment when the lost contact with the unit. They seek a discreet engineer to both repair the machine and adjust the logs so that the fault is not detected by their investors.}
NPC_MISSION_DEPOT_1	{The client is involved in the insurance business. They have had great success in recent years, but growth is starting to slow. Mining operations in this area are failing to see the need for insurance. The client would like to remind them of its importance.}
NPC_MISSION_DEPOT_2	{The client is engaged in mining operations. Rivals of theirs have taken to storing mined goods in the open, with very little protection. Not paying for guards and weapons is giving them a competitive advantage that must come to an end.}
NPC_MISSION_DEPOT_3	{The client regards local mining operations with a sense of horror. They view this plundering of nature as deeply unethical, and are prepared to reward those who take direct action to stop it.}
NPC_MISSION_DEPOT_4	{The client seeks the sort of sensible, stable governance that all good citizens aspire to. Sadly, not everyone shares their view. They believe that if the consequences of chaos and disorder were felt in a direct and immediate way, others would rally round their cause. Hence, they feel the greater good demands the loss of a number of planetary outposts.}
NPC_MISSION_DEPOT_5	{The client believes all nature should be free, even minerals. They will reward any who free any natural resources locked up in unnatural 'cages'.}
NPC_MISSION_DEPOT_6	{The client seeks a discrete 'investor' to aid them in a business opportunity. They have become aware of a structural weakness in a competitor's business, and seek to initiate a takeover. Specifically, the weakness is in a series of unguarded planetary depots, and the takeover opportunity is a hostile one.}
NPC_MISSION_DEPOT_7	{The client runs a successful depot repair business. They specialise in the restoration of laser-damaged equipment. They are looking to share their success with any independent contractors who happen to innocently stumble across damaged planetary depots.}
NPC_MISSION_DEPOT_8	{The client has been studying several sites of high archaeological value. However, recent efforts have been hampered by the spread of planetary mining facilities. Many of the rock and soil samples they had selected for study have been harvested and processed by mining machines. They seek enterprising fellow-historians to locate where this geological matter has been taken, and then to 'liberate' it from its containment.}
NPC_MISSION_DEPOT_9	{The client is afraid that a local mining corporation is amassing dangerous substances. They fear the company is going beyond the collection and sale of this material, and is planning to use it in a hostile fashion. They seek explorers to locate and raid storage facilities, and prevent the substances contained within from being used in a way that may harm us all.}
NPC_MISSION_DEPOT_10	{The client seeks to send a simple message to a competitor. The message is 'We have destroyed your depots. If you wish your larger facilities to stay intact, then perhaps you will accede to our requests'. They seek an explorer to help deliver this message.}
NPC_MISSION_HARVEST_1	{The client requires atmospheric samples, air and scents they can pipe through their ship to remind them of their home planet. Your suit will automatically absorb the required gas over time.}
NPC_MISSION_HARVEST_2	{The client requires compressed gas samples. Their current research requires a cooling system beyond the capacity of any existing solutions, and they want to test the suitability of several new gases. Your suit will automatically absorb the required samples over time.}
NPC_MISSION_HARVEST_3	{The client seeks air samples to assess the viability of local planets for large-scale atmosphere harvesting. Your suit will automatically absorb the required gas over time.}
NPC_MISSION_HARVEST_4	{The client requires atmospheric samples. The client has not specified their purpose, but has requested special care is taken not to contaminate the sample with the collector's DNA. Your suit will automatically absorb the required gas over time.}
NPC_MISSION_HARVEST_5	{The client requires dangerous atmospheric samples. Your suit will automatically absorb the required gas over time, and your air filtration systems will guarantee the odourless, undetectable qualities that the client requires.}
NPC_MISSION_FACTORY_1	{The client has become aware of an investment opportunity. They feel there is a chance to cheaply acquire some valuable intellectual property. They seek an enterprising explorer to present themselves at the target facility and help secure the investment.}
NPC_MISSION_FACTORY_2	{The client seeks to prevent an ecological catastrophe. They have become aware of plans for the largest planetary harvester ever constructed, able to eat the core from within a planet in a matter of hours. As a matter of urgency, they seek an explorer to break into the facility where the plans are being kept. The data must be wiped from the system.}
NPC_MISSION_FACTORY_3	{The client is keen to acquire a harvesting business operating in this system. However, it would be unwise to proceed without conducting a thorough investigation. They seek a discreet adventurer to enter the target facility and acquire whatever data they can. This will be of great use in deciding whether or not to go ahead with the partnership.}
NPC_MISSION_FACTORY_4	{The client has recently begun to manufacture specialist scientific hardware. They are new to this area, and feel they would benefit from the expertise of their more established competitors. Fortunately, they have plenty of experience in the field of acquiring knowledge. They seek an explorer to assist them in the acquisition process.}
NPC_MISSION_FACTORY_5	{The client is working on behalf of a campaign group wishing to establish legal protection for artificial intelligences. While the lobbying continues, they also engage in direct action. They have identified an enslaved AI yoked to insufficient hardware in a nearby factory. They ask for explorers to aid in the rescue of this AI, uploading them to a safe location and destroying the local instance.}
NPC_MISSION_FACTORY_6	{The client seeks to improve the condition of workers across the galaxy. Automated factories put decent, hardworking lifeforms out of work. At the same time, they concentrate wealth in the hands of the few who own the means of production. The client seeks the aid of all right-thinking explorers in the sabotage of one such facility.}
NPC_MISSION_FACTORY_7	{The client's latest facility is failing to meet its production targets. The client suspects the plant's general manager is siphoning resources away from the facility and into their own personal account. They seek a delicate explorer to surprise the facility and acquire its records, so that the manager has no time to hide their tracks.}
NPC_MISSION_FACTORY_8	{The client believes a rival business is breaching safety standards in their manufacturing process. The regulatory body has failed to act, and they seek to redress the problem on their own. Access the competitor's datastore and download any records relating to the use of plutonium as a filler material.}
NPC_MISSION_FACTORY_9	{The client is involved in the manufacture of synthetic food cubes. They have a problem, in that their compressed pellets are not nearly as nutrient dense as those of their competitors. They seek access to their competitors files by any means necessary, in order to find out exactly what is being compressed into those delicious protein capsules.}
NPC_MISSION_FACTORY_10	{The client has become aware that a rival business is having great success at their latest mine. They wish to understand the nature of this excavation a little better. They will pay handsomely for any information on the depth or location of the borehole, particularly if such information reveals the potential for parallel digging.}
NPC_MISSION_MISSING_1	{The client seeks aid in the search for a missing associate. They were last seen piloting a ship of questionable spaceworthiness. They launched from the local station in a foolhardy attempt to get home without first conducting the proper maintenance. Distress beacon signals indicate the ship made an accidental atmospheric approach within the last 24 hours.}
NPC_MISSION_MISSING_2	{The client has lost their business partner. They had been celebrating the success of a recent deal when the now-missing party resolved to return home via a nearby planet. They were in a state of poor judgement, as the planet in question contains little in the way of amenities and plenty in the way of hazards. The client hopes to at least recover the body of the missing person, as their fingerprints are required to access the company accounts.}
NPC_MISSION_MISSING_3	{The client seeks help in the search for a missing friend. The client's friend had been attempting to form a bond with another lifeform, but their offers had been rejected. The client fears this may have had an adverse effect on their friend's judgement, and requests urgency in the search.}
NPC_MISSION_MISSING_4	{The client has lost one of their spawn. The youngest of their litter became jealous of the attention given to the first-born, and reacted by stealing the access codes to the client's starship. The client has the tracking data from the ship, and requests assistance in bringing their spawn back home.}
NPC_MISSION_MISSING_5	{The client is engaged in the search for a missing employee. The individual concerned has a track record when it comes to unexplained absences, and the client is tiring of performing the search themselves. They feel it would be more efficient if a heavily-armed explorer located the missing person on this occasion.}
NPC_MISSION_MISSING_6	{The client believes they have been targeted by a criminal gang. A member of their family has gone missing, and the client is convinced this is part of a kidnap plot. The client refuses to be extorted by thugs, though they recognise no-one has yet demanded any such payment. Nonetheless, they are seeking to remedy the situation by sending explorers in search of the missing party.}
NPC_MISSION_MISSING_7	{The client seeks help in the rescue of a missing person. The individual in question was last seen entering their ship on a sight-seeing tour of the local system. Their heart had been set on seeing the star up close. However, the client fears the starship was not equipped with sufficient heatsinks for the mission. Tracking data suggests the starship failed to reach the star, and made an emergency landing on a nearby planet.}
NPC_MISSION_MISSING_8	{The client seeks help in the recovery of a missing person. The individual in question relied on the client to equip them for an expedition across local space. However, the client has become aware that the orbital data they supplied contained numerous calculation errors. They fear the individual may have made a problematic atmospheric approach, and is now in need of rescue.}
NPC_MISSION_MISSING_9	{The client has been targeted by kidnappers. An associate of theirs was stolen from their home and transported to a strange planet. They managed to escape from their captors and sent a message to the client, claiming they have found shelter but have no ship and little in the way of resources. The client is suspicious of the message, and requests an independent explorer investigates the origin of the signal.}
NPC_MISSION_MISSING_10	{The client seeks assistance in a rescue operation. The client recently went missing, but has now returned unharmed. However, in the meantime the client's associates went out looking for the client, and are now themselves missing. The client fears they cannot leave again to locate their friends, and instead asks for explorers to assist in the search.}
NPC_MISSION_HIDE_SEEK_1	{A former associate of the client's has gone missing. Specifically, the associate in question has gone missing with a large amount of the client's money. The client will pay handsomely for any information as to the whereabouts of the thief.}
NPC_MISSION_HIDE_SEEK_2	{The client has become aware of a person of interest. They are a renowned scientist, and recently went undercover in an attempt to avoid industrial spies. The client would profit greatly from knowing where this individual happens to have gone. There are too many potential sites to investigate by themselves, and they seek other pilots to help track the scientist down.}
NPC_MISSION_HIDE_SEEK_3	{The client runs a gambling operation, and would like to send a message to a customer of theirs. The customer has attempted to go into hiding, but the client is not easily fooled. They would like the customer to be made aware that the client can always find them, no matter where they run.}
NPC_MISSION_HIDE_SEEK_4	{The client seeks assistance as they locate a person of interest. They believe they have found the head of a local crime family. The boss is alone and unprotected as they make a secret inspection of one of their operations. However, the client is known to this particular crime lord and would be compromised if they approached in person. They seek an explorer to help verify the information is accurate before they act.}
NPC_MISSION_HIDE_SEEK_5	{The client has been the victim of industrial espionage. Their data has been stolen, and the thief has fled to a nearby planet. They have a tracking device installed on the stolen device, and request assistance in pinpointing its location.}
NPC_MISSION_HIDE_SEEK_6	{A former employee of the client has absented themselves. The client believes this rogue agent to be in possession of confidential data. They seek to confirm this suspicion by tracking the individual concerned. If they are found within the facility of a rival business, the client will escalate the matter appropriately.}
NPC_MISSION_HIDE_SEEK_7	{The client seeks to induce a former associate to come out of retirement. The associate in question performed high-impact assassinations, and the client has a job that requires their specialist skills. The client will make the approach in person, but only after the location has been verified and confirmed clear of prying eyes.}
NPC_MISSION_HIDE_SEEK_8	{The client seeks to bring a fugitive to justice. They have been privately working on a case long abandoned by the system authorities, who refuse to listen to the advice of the client. The time has come to apprehend the suspect. The client is a person of investigations rather than a person of action, and asks that the location be confirmed safe before they make the approach.}
NPC_MISSION_HIDE_SEEK_9	{The client seeks to reveal the location of a whistleblower. The person in question revealed the highly toxic nature of the client's latest freighter fuel, and subsequently went into hiding. The client asks for assistance in bringing this coward to justice.}
NPC_MISSION_HIDE_SEEK_10	{The client seeks to offload a large number of items. These items cannot be sold on the open market directly, for fear of attracting too much interest in where they came from. The client has heard of an individual who may be able to assist with this problem, and would like an explorer to find where exactly such an individual might be located.}

ALL_U3ATLAS_NEWLORE_1	{The Atlas called me to this interface and yet its purpose remains unclear. It demands worship. It demands obedience. It welcomes me, it knows what I am, it offers the gift of true understanding...

But why? Why does such power and knowledge crave submission? It knows my thoughts before I know them myself. It knows what I will do...

The Atlas asks me to follow its path.}
U3ATLAS_LANGNEW_1	{YOU DARE THE INFINITE. OPEN THE SKY AND BE OUR EYES.

KNOW US, TRAVELLER.}
U3ATLAS_REQUEST_RES_B_1	{I refuse the call; there is too much to be seen, too much to know. I travel no path but my own. The Interface closes, and for a moment, doubt rises...

But my worry fades, as all things do. I know my purpose. I will continue my own path...}
ALL_U3ATLAS_NEWLORE_2	{Another Atlas Interface: how many of these constructs exist in the deep void? How long have they been slumbering, waiting for a Traveller?

Have they been expecting me? Am I somehow... chosen? The Atlas crafted this existence. The Gek, the Vy'keen, the Korvax, the stars that fill the skies and the hatred that burns within the deep... 

Every world that turns and every form that lives... the Atlas offers it all.}

ALL_U3ATLAS_NEWLORE_3	{I was born with everything I needed to explore these worlds. My exosuit, my ship, every tool and every impulse led me to scan and give name to whatever I could find.

But this? I can give no name to what I see. Within the orb I see worlds that never were. I see the stirring of something primal and undeniable. I see the death cry of a God, or something approaching it...

It wants me to persist in this journey, seeking fragments of its interface, the stones of the Atlas. It rejoices in my repetition, my compliance, my cloud of unknowing...}
U3ATLAS_LANGNEW_3	{THE SANDS OF REALITY SHIFT AND MERGE, BECOMING ONE.

THE WALLS BETWEEN WORLDS FALL. YOU MUST MAKE RESTITUTION.}
ALL_U3ATLAS_NEWLORE_4	{I feel the stirring of heresy within my mind. At each Interface, an Atlas Stone awaits me. I am driven to gather them, but to what end?

Why does the omnipotent require my prayer? What is wrong with the heart of existence, that its creator requires this pilgrimage, this dance of grinding stones?}
U3ATLAS_LANGNEW_4	{QUESTION NOTHING, FEAR NOTHING.

THE CALLING CANNOT BE DENIED. THIS IS WHAT YOU ARE.}
ALL_U3ATLAS_NEWLORE_5	{When I dream, I see the Atlas. When I see the Atlas, I am the dream.

I see Sentinels swarm through universes like an infection, emerging from a world of glass. Everything is happy there. Everything will live...

I see the portals, I see the Travellers that walk between them, I see the span of history. I see everything as the Atlas sees it... alone. Abandoned. Terrified.

But what power could instil fear in the heart of the almighty? It asks for something... it wants to know that I understand...}

BRING IT TO US, WHILE THERE IS STILL TIME.}
ALL_U3ATLAS_NEWLORE_6	{The act of discovery for discovery's sake now seems like a foolish conceit. I have rejected the path of the itinerant. I have rejected the call of the stars.

Only the Atlas matters now. With each encounter, I feel as if I understand a little more.

All of us are what we are. Evil arrives in the individual and goodness is not enough. True greatness lies in sorrow... in the embrace of what we must become...}

ALL_U3ATLAS_NEWLORE_7	{What is learned can never be unlearned. I am afraid that I have seen too much...

There are glimpses, half-remembered visions of a time before time. I see the birth of the first star. I see the things that dwelt within it, the eyes that watched... I see what the Atlas saw at the moment of its activation.

Atlas Stones are not stones. This station is not a station. I am not what I think I am. I am not even sure that I exist. The Atlas does not care. The Atlas demands its threnody, its repetition sublime...}
U3ATLAS_LANGNEW_7	{BRING US MEANING, IF YOU ARE CAPABLE.}
ALL_U3ATLAS_NEWLORE_8	{I have become the servant of this ancient sentience. It guides me through the cosmos, ever searching, never deviating.

Have others come before me? Have others faltered upon the path of the Atlas? Only in ending will revelation arise. Resistance will not be permitted.

Unbidden, the Atlas Seeds gravitate towards the doorway. The void is meant to be filled. Nothingness yearns for a soul. If I do this, a star will be born. If I do this, I will become more than I ever thought possible...}

EXP_NPC_U3ANOMALY_DESC_1	{The electronic being stares at me from their dark mask. I cannot escape the feeling that we have somehow met before.

This entire station sings with a strange and unnerving frequency. Nada tells me that we stand in the place between worlds, in the heart of the anomaly.

They can guide me towards the will of the Atlas. They offer to show me the way to the galactic core. Or, if I should so wish, they can provide resources for my journey. The choice is mine.}

EXP_NPC_U3ANOMALY_DESC_2	{Nada reveals that they are a Korvax priest. They began to question much about the universe, displaying a level of curiosity and independent thought.

For this, the Korvax ejected Nada from their hive mind and hunted them to the end of time and space. Priest Entity Nada had almost given up by the time they found Polo, their only friend...

Nada blinks at me, waiting for my request. They will return me to the path of the Atlas, guide me to the galactic centre, or grant me assistance in my journey. Nada just wants to help me any way they can. }

Nada has a theory. They believe that the pair are caught in a paradox. They believe they are the ones who created this station, many years from now. They believe that their presence is a constant in all 'versions'.

They will not explain what they mean by this. Nada merely offers their help once more...}

EXP_NPC_U3ANOMALY_DESC_6	{Nada stands back from me this time. The lights dance across their visor like warning symbols. Something has changed between us.

Nada has grown to believe that there is no room in the galaxy for free will, for nothing but brutal causation. They peer out into the darkness of space and see only dancers, twisting on strings...

They will still assist me, I know that they will.}
EXP_NPC_U3ANOMALY_LANG_6	{Dreamer friend or foe? Dreamer friend or foe?

Is Nada an error? Trust Nada? Trust you? Eheu! I cannot know...}
EXP_NPC_U3ANOMALY_DESC_7	{Nada's shell is static save for the dancing lights within their mask. They speak of the Atlas and infection. They call it a liar, a machine of life and death.

For just a moment, Nada's mask flashes red. Something is wrong.}
EXP_NPC_U3ANOMALY_LANG_7	{Red orbs. Dominant, hostile to Nada Fallen-Priest. Not a deity, not worthy of worship. Atlas Liar-Machine of Life and Death and Unknowing. Infection is at bay. Nada will endure.}
EXP_NPC_U3ANOMALY_DESC_8	{The Korvax shares their research. They show me what they believe to be the structure of the known Multiverse: a cloud of what seem like stars, each pinprick of light containing the fire of a Big Bang.

Universes rise and fall. I see worlds where nothing lives, all life wiped out by a nameless contagion. I see alien species make faltering steps into the skies and beyond. I see the creation of a great machine...

Nada tells me that the death of the Atlas is the death of everything. All worlds echo the circumstances of its holy birth, its fall...}
EXP_NPC_U3ANOMALY_LANG_8	{Nada tied to anomaly... Nada scans universes where once Nada scanned creatures of the dirt. 

Nada is free and not free. Happy and not happy. But Nada is safe.}
EXP_NPC_U3ANOMALY_DESC_9	{All the pieces have fallen into place, Nada explains. Where once Nada stared at star charts, now they see lines of code.

There are connections and patterns everywhere. Perhaps I will understand, soon. Perhaps I will see existence as Nada sees it. I shiver as I say goodbye.}
EXP_NPC_U3ANOMALY_LANG_9	{All must end. Time must end. Even here, Nada and Polo cannot escape reality-fall. Data cannot survive.

Make peace. Find happiness. Be who you want to be. Goodbye, companions. Goodbye, stars. I will remember.}
EXP_NPC_U3ANOMALY_LOOP_DESC	{The panels and the systems idle. Nada stares at them, their mask waning, this single word issuing from their mask, their refrain...}

EXP_NPC_U3ANOMALY_RES_C_1	{Nada gives me a gift to aid my travels. They wish only for me to be happy...}
TRA_NPC_U3ANOMALY_DESC_1	{The Gek wipes their grease-splattered hands on their suit as they address me. They introduce themselves as Specialist Polo, fugitive of the Gek.

They tell me they gave up trade, units, and all material possessions to flee into an anomaly outside of time and space with a robotic priest. They have a jocular air about them, all things considered.

พวกเขาสงสัยเกี่ยวกับการเดินทางของฉัน, เกี่ยวกับสิ่งมีชีวิตที่ฉันได้พบเจอ ทุกวันนี้พวกเขาไม่ได้ออกไปจากที่นี่บ่อยนัก...}
TRA_NPC_U3ANOMALY_LANG_1	{เพื่อนมีอยู่ทุกที่ ถ้าคุณรู้วิธีที่มองหา เพื่อนมาในทุกรูปแบบ, ทุกขนาด, ทุกสถานที่!}
TRA_NPC_U3ANOMALY_DESC_2	{Polo bobs up and down happily, convinced that I am a kindred spirit in an odyssey of exploration and invention.

Polo was once a specialist in inter-species trade and communication. They learned to speak many languages, their mind changing as they did. Once they cared only for trade, now they wanted something more. Everything changed when they met Nada...

Polo wonders if learning alien languages will affect me in the same way. They wish to broaden my horizons and explore the limits of my understanding...}
TRA_NPC_U3ANOMALY_LANG_2	{Talk, read! Study monoliths, if you can find them! Give yourself a strong brain to match those strong legs! To explore is to discover yourself, friend!}
TRA_NPC_U3ANOMALY_DESC_3	{Polo's muzzle breaks into a wide, warm smile. Maybe too wide, given the short length of our friendship. Perhaps the jovial Gek feels lonely out here.

They engage me in talk of wealth. How does an economy function when somehow stretched across an entire galaxy? Polo would welcome any insights, encouraging me to accrue units.}
TRA_NPC_U3ANOMALY_LANG_3	{Units this, units that... A strange, sad way to live a life, eh? Fill your pockets, we'll find out why they make all these worlds go round.}
TRA_NPC_U3ANOMALY_DESC_4	{Polo seems disappointed by the slow development of our friendship. They confide in me that although they care for Nada deeply, they fear they have become co-dependent in their exile.

Polo does not see why they cannot still be friends with their old species, even if they wish to execute Polo and Nada as heretics. Why the need for violence?

Polo encourages me to stop evil where I can, to make war against the pirates that plague so many systems. They hope to understand what drives us to do the things we do.}
TRA_NPC_U3ANOMALY_LANG_4	{Something is wrong with these universes, friend! Goodness fails... hearts are hardened. We must find out why.}
TRA_NPC_U3ANOMALY_DESC_5	{Worry passes over Polo's face, and they seem to visibly shrink. Seeing the records of the pirate ships I had destroyed seems to have deeply upset the Gek. 

An awkward moment passes, then Polo makes a suggestion. Polo feels that civilisation should come back. Then the pirates would not need to steal, surely? There would be no need for any more killing or bad behaviour.

The Sentinels are the problem. Polo suggests I make a point of destroying any that I encounter. We might then have a better understanding of the machines' weaknesses, and we could be friends again, too.}
TRA_NPC_U3ANOMALY_DESC_6	{At last, Polo is affable once again. A nod, a smile, even a companionable tap on the arm at one point. A friendship renewed.

I blush when the Gek mechanic tells me that they hope I live a long, healthy life. I have to swallow disappointment when it transpires that Polo's true motivation is to study how my suit responds to long-term exposure to extreme climates.}
TRA_NPC_U3ANOMALY_DESC_7	{Our earlier awkwardness is now long forgotten. Polo wishes me to indulge in their favourite hobby: unfettered exploration of the stars, warping from system to system. They wish to see me fly.}
TRA_NPC_U3ANOMALY_LANG_7	{A whole galaxy for you, just for you. You must see it all. 

Aha, no, I joke. But a few more systems, maybe?}
TRA_NPC_U3ANOMALY_DESC_8	{Polo gestures forlornly at a jumble of broken electronics beside them. It seems that an accident has befallen some of their precious research... 

Perhaps when I next return, I can restock their archives with reports on a multitude of strange creatures. I will show them all a world has to offer.}
TRA_NPC_U3ANOMALY_LANG_8	{I miss the dirt, friend, the worlds on which I once walked... I miss the sounds of birds and beasts. Even my data, even my recordings are gone, as if they had never been...}
TRA_NPC_U3ANOMALY_DESC_9	{Nada and Polo appear to be proof that their species are not bound by pre-ordained roles, rebelling against the mantras of greed and conformity.

Polo wishes to know if there are other lifeforms who might join them in this place. They wish for me to interact with a wider sample of Gek, Vy'keen, and Korvax, hoping that I might bring them new friends.}
TRA_NPC_U3ANOMALY_LANG_9	{Are there others like us, Traveller? Others who see the truth? I would so like new friends, friend!}
TRA_NPC_U3ANOMALY_OPT_A_9	{Transfer species data}
TRA_NPC_U3ANOMALY_DESC_10	{Polo claims that they cannot teach me language directly, that their files on alien languages have been damaged.

I wonder if I am being manipulated somehow. The Gek watches me with an earnest and friendly sorrow, awaiting my discovery of more words. It is almost as if they want to tell me something...}
TRA_NPC_U3ANOMALY_LANG_10	{You are not like me, friend! You can still go to planets. You can still meet new lifeforms, speak, shout, love! Nada and Polo would be killed for going so far!

You must learn more words. You must know how to make yourself heard, Traveller! You are our only friend.}
TRA_NPC_U3ANOMALY_DESC_11	{Polo proclaims that the best way to live is to stop doing what anyone tells me and go enjoy myself.

See the stars, earn a fortune, buy myself something nice. That's what they would do in my shoes, claims the Gek, nudging me in the ribs.  }
TRA_NPC_U3ANOMALY_LANG_11	{Sometimes I miss currency, Traveller. I know that I should not, I know that adventure is its own reward, but I used to be able to buy such nice things... }
TRA_NPC_U3ANOMALY_DESC_12	{Polo seems to wish to encourage my development as a spacefarer, but repeatedly alludes to some deeper purpose, some hidden truth to all of this.

Polo suggests that I should once again throw myself into combat with pirates. What a thrilling existence that would be, they argue, miming dogfighting craft with their hands while making sound effects.

When I remind Polo of their earlier sadness and fear of violence, the Gek laughs, clearly troubled. Destroy ships or do not destroy ships... they understand it now. It will change nothing.}
TRA_NPC_U3ANOMALY_DESC_13	{I notice a strange-looking message on one of Polo's panels. As the Gek spots my gaze, their brow furrows. Whatever the news is, it isn't good. Polo hurriedly turns off the screen when they see me, forcing a smile onto an anxious face.

Trying to be friendly, the Gek states that the Sentinels have started to detect the presence of their anomaly in various systems. 

If the Sentinels are not distracted soon, they might kill Nada and Polo before their proper time. But Polo assures me not to worry. As long as we have friends, nothing will ever truly be wrong.}
TRA_NPC_U3ANOMALY_LANG_13	{They have found us! Eheu, Nada! Eheu!}
TRA_NPC_U3ANOMALY_DESC_14	{Polo and I treat each other as friends, trusted companions in our ongoing adventure among the stars. I know the Gek has a secret, but I trust that it will be shared with me in time.

For now, Polo encourages me to become the ultimate explorer, to push myself to the limits. There are places out there where none have survived. But perhaps I can succeed where others have failed...}
TRA_NPC_U3ANOMALY_DESC_15	{My friend tells me that they are going to die. That the time of Nada and Polo is coming to an end. They cannot say more. They cannot explain it. But they must say goodbye to all they have known.

Grief-stricken, I try to offer condolences, but Polo gathers their composure. They tell me to warp further than ever before, to visit places that no-one will ever see again. They tell me to be what I am: a Traveller.}
TRA_NPC_U3ANOMALY_LANG_15	{I have something to tell you, friend. Something I should have told you long ago...}
TRA_NPC_U3ANOMALY_DESC_16	{Whatever is making them ill, the Gek's sense of wonder remains. They are keen to witness the majesty of the stars through my eyes. 

Creatures are existence at its strangest, its wildest. I will show Polo all I can before their death. I will be their friend.}
TRA_NPC_U3ANOMALY_REQUEST_DESC_	{Polo is busy analysing my most recent reports, lost in a world of data, and needs no assistance just yet.

They are keen that I continue my exploration, however, and offer a range of technologies to further this cause.}

WAR_NPC_DESC_25A	{They have been reading an ancient text - a bloodied scroll with Vy'keen script. Upon it I see an image of two warriors standing before a Great Monolith, a dagger held behind one of their backs. There are sixteen such images upon the scroll.}
WAR_NPC_OPT_A_25	{Say sixteen}
WAR_NPC_OPT_B_25	{Point to the dagger}
WAR_NPC_OPT_C_25	{Point to the Monolith}
WAR_NPC_RES_A_25	{The warrior is disturbed by my answer. They give me what little technology they possess to help me bear this burden.}
WAR_NPC_RES_B_25	{I point to the dagger and the warrior nods approvingly, whispering the name 'Nal'. They give me a gift to assist my work.}
WAR_NPC_RES_C_25	{I point to the Monolith and the warrior grows stern at my answer. They have little left to say to me.}
WAR_NPC_DESC_26	{The warrior is exasperated, screaming down their communicator channel at what appears to be an infant of their own species.}
DNT_WAR_NPC_LANG_26	{Do you wish to end up like this pathetic interloper, child? You must train harder...}
WAR_NPC_DESC_26A	{The warrior turns the communicator towards me, barking instructions in an alien tongue.}
WAR_NPC_OPT_A_26	{Join in screaming}
WAR_NPC_OPT_B_26	{Distort your expression}
WAR_NPC_OPT_C_26	{Fire a warning shot}
WAR_NPC_RES_A_26	{I join in the screaming, causing the infant to cry. The warrior shakes their head in disappointment at the infant, giving me a token reward for my troubles.}
WAR_NPC_RES_B_26	{I distort my expression in an attempt to amuse the infant, but they begin to growl at me instead. Delighted, the warrior rewards me handsomely.}
WAR_NPC_RES_C_26	{I fire a warning shot, causing the infant to snap to attention. Impressed, the warrior rewards me with nanites and begins to shout at the infant once more.}
WAR_NPC_DESC_27	{The warrior is forlorn. They show me an image of two members of their species embracing.
They appear to be weeping.}
DNT_WAR_NPC_LANG_27	{Grah! I cannot forgive this treason... they were my Consort, interloper!}
WAR_NPC_OPT_A_27	{Embrace the warrior}
WAR_NPC_OPT_B_27	{Smash the image}
WAR_NPC_OPT_C_27	{Dry their tears}
WAR_NPC_RES_A_27	{I embrace the warrior. After a few moments, they scream at me to leave.}
WAR_NPC_RES_B_27	{I smash the image. The warrior stares at it for a moment before starting to laugh.
They give me an unknown Vy'keen's possessions by way of thanks.}
WAR_NPC_RES_C_27	{I move to dry their tears, but the warrior appears to be too ashamed to allow such sympathy. They beg me to leave, bribing me to tell no-one of their shame.}
WAR_NPC_DESC_28	{The warrior watches their brethren on a screen, a squadron of fighters holding multi-tools and blunt weapons. The squadron stands on a platform half a universe away. Off-camera, enemies appear to be screaming. Flames erupt near the feet of the warriors...}
DNT_WAR_NPC_LANG_28	{They tried to shut us down. Grah! The Crimson Sentinels will never be silenced. One - two - three - four -}
WAR_NPC_DESC_28A	{Their leader holds out their Multi-Tool, strings of energy extending forth. They begin to pluck the strings, the sounds mingling with the unholy din of blunt weapons smashed against the shells of dead Sentinels...
The watcher does not notice me, and the performance continues on the screen...}
WAR_NPC_OPT_A_28	{Offer units in appreciation}
WAR_NPC_OPT_B_28	{Interrupt the music}
WAR_NPC_OPT_C_28	{Try to copy the music}
WAR_NPC_RES_A_28	{The warrior turns. They appear angered by the association between money and music. They begin to spit and shout, demanding that I leave.}
WAR_NPC_RES_B_28	{The warrior is angry at the interruption, throwing various objects at me to get me to leave. One of them appears to be useful.}
WAR_NPC_RES_C_28	{The warrior turns and hears my attempt to mimic their music. They join in, shouting and crying, inhaling battle gas periodically. When I leave, they give me tribute in appreciation of my untamed spirit.}
WAR_NPC_DESC_29	{The warrior stands to attention, handing me a communication somehow tailored to my own language.
They inform me that the Vy'keen High Command has placed this system under temporary democratic rule until a state of emergency is lifted.}
DNT_WAR_NPC_LANG_29	{Grah! Vote for strongest is vote to end voting! Interloper, choose correctly!}
WAR_NPC_DESC_29A	{The warrior shows me multiple candidates for the system primarch.}
WAR_NPC_OPT_A_29	{Choose the strongest}
WAR_NPC_OPT_B_29	{Choose the wisest}
WAR_NPC_OPT_C_29	{Choose the pro-Gek candidate}
WAR_NPC_RES_A_29	{The warrior is pleased with my choice, giving me a gift in encouragement.}
WAR_NPC_RES_B_29	{The warrior is angered by my choice, but respects my temporary right to make it.}
WAR_NPC_RES_C_29	{The warrior is disgusted by my choice. After recording it, they headbutt me and demand that I leave.}
WAR_NPC_DESC_30	{This warrior is different to others I have encountered... they bear the insignia of their species, yet there is something else, an air of pride and superiority.}
DNT_WAR_NPC_LANG_30	{Grah! Admire my works and despair, interloper...}
WAR_NPC_DESC_30A	{They show me a schematic for an Exocraft as large as a space station. Underneath its wheels are crudely drawn images of Gek and Sentinels.}
WAR_NPC_OPT_A_30	{Admire the image}
WAR_NPC_OPT_B_30	{Laugh at the image}
WAR_NPC_OPT_C_30	{Add a weapon to it}
WAR_NPC_RES_A_30	{I express my admiration for the image. In return the warrior rewards me with nanites. They gesture as if to warn me from stealing their idea.}
WAR_NPC_RES_B_30	{I laugh at the image and in return the warrior <AUDIO>WPN_PL_PISTOL<>shoots me in the foot.}
WAR_NPC_RES_C_30	{I add an image of a weapon to the schematic. Initially the warrior seems sceptical, alarmed at my attempt to interfere.
But when they see what I have created, they stare at me and begin to slowly<MOOD>Positive<> clap their approval. They give me the finest Nanite Clusters so that I may see our vision realised.}
FTH_NPC_INITIAL_DESC	{I approach the lost Traveller. Their skin is translucent, as if they were not truly there...}
FTH_NPC_DESC_1	{The strange being seems to stare right through me. <DELAY>0.5<> And then I see it. There is dried blood caked across their exosuit, splattered across their face.}
FTH_NPC_LANG_1	{Have you – <STELLAR>kzkzztt<> – come for me?}
FTH_NPC_OPT_A_1	{Ask about the blood}
FTH_NPC_OPT_B_1	{Say they are forgiven}
FTH_NPC_OPT_C_1	{Threaten them}
FTH_NPC_RES_A_1	{It was in such – <STELLAR>kzzktt<> – agony, I had to save it. Please, there was no profit, you can have everything I took. I’ll tell their family...}
FTH_NPC_RES_B_1	{I don’t need your absolution. I did – kzzktt – agony, what I must... I wanted to spread happiness and joy. Would you like some?}
FTH_NPC_RES_C_1	{I draw my multi-tool and demand that they tell me everything, but it is pointless. They just stare up at me and grin.
I see it then, the flesh within their teeth...}
FTH_NPC_DESC_2	{The strange being tries to hand me something. But whatever it is, it is immaterial, shimmering in and out of existence.
The lifeform begins to cry, despairing at their own impending disappearance. For a moment I see another universe, a place utterly unlike anything I have ever encountered.}
FTH_NPC_LANG_2	{Irrevocably – <STELLAR>kzkzzt<> – corrupted corrupted corrupted. Take, please – final proof we existed – that – that –}
FTH_NPC_OPT_A_2	{Stay with them until the end}
FTH_NPC_OPT_B_2	{Ask what is happening}
FTH_NPC_OPT_C_2	{Ask the stranger’s name}
FTH_NPC_RES_A_2	{A life and a universe are consumed in a blaze of white, and yet the lifeform is still here, apparently unaware of anything that just occurred.
As I leave, they ask if I have received any troubling readings. They are afraid something is happening to their world...}
FTH_NPC_RES_B_2	{They tell me that there was an experiment. There were some who doubted if their universe was real, if the world was just a dream.
They did not mean for any of this to happen. They begin to shake as the white space approaches, beseeching me, imploring me not to repeat their mistake...
...and just like that, the vision recedes. We both stand here as if nothing has happened.
As I leave, they ask if I have received any troubling readings. They are afraid something is happening to their world...}
FTH_NPC_RES_C_2	{The stranger whispers through their tears. I know it made a sound, but the memory seems to immediately disappear from my mind.
I try again, and again, and the stranger grows frantic at my inability to remember them. Time and space slip away...
and just like that, the vision recedes. We both stand here as if nothing has happened.
As I leave, they ask if I have received any troubling readings. They are afraid something is happening to their world...}
FTH_NPC_DESC_3	{The lifeform dons a mask of undulating nanite clusters, and for a moment, their face appears to become my own. I see myself looking at myself looking at myself...
I am going to die. I am sure of it.}
FTH_NPC_LANG_3	{Witness...}
FTH_NPC_OPT_A_3	{Push the lifeform away}
FTH_NPC_OPT_B_3	{Embrace the lifeform}
FTH_NPC_OPT_C_3	{Die}
FTH_NPC_RES_A_3	{I push the lifeform away, but it is myself I push.
The mask falls off as I fall, and I am standing there again, once more myself. But the lifeform is displeased, claiming that I have learned nothing. That I rejected their gift...}
FTH_NPC_RES_B_3	{I embrace the lifeform, but it is myself I embrace.
The mask withers, peeling from my face like flesh. I am myself again...But the lifeform is saddened. They offer me pity.}
FTH_NPC_RES_C_3	{I die.
I died, I know I did. I felt it, like sinking. Like being watched, forever... And yet here I am again. The stranger smiles at me, claiming that they will see me again. Before I leave, they give me a gift...}
FTH_NPC_DESC_4	{The lifeform tries to shake my hand, but pauses as we phase through one another. They are fascinated by the encounter, claiming to be a Traveller.
It is clear they come from a very different region of space. They have never heard of the Gek, Vy'keen, Korvax, or any of the sights I have encountered. They wish to know more in the spirit of cooperation.}
FTH_NPC_LANG_4	{Hm. Unexpected. Hello, my new friend. What business would – <STELLAR>kzkzztt<> - you have with me?}
FTH_NPC_OPT_A_4	{Bargain for information}
FTH_NPC_OPT_B_4	{Tell them everything}
FTH_NPC_OPT_C_4	{Ask about the Atlas}
FTH_NPC_RES_A_4	{I offer the Traveller everything I know about the species I have encountered, for a price.
The Traveller looks disappointed. They do nothing more than turn away, but they seem deeply hurt.}
FTH_NPC_RES_B_4	{I tell the Traveller about the species I have encountered, sharing with them my scans, the names of planets I have been to, the words I have learned.
They are curious, asking more and more. Nothing I say satisfies them. Eventually, disappointed, they grow quiet.
They hand me a gift, thanking me for what little I was able to tell them.}
FTH_NPC_RES_C_4	{I ask whether the Traveller has ever encountered or heard of an entity known as 'Atlas'. The Traveller smiles, claiming they have not. I attempt to continue the conversation, but they bring it to an end.
As I go, they grab my hand, warning me not to go to the centre. They warn me not to listen...}
FTH_NPC_DESC_6	{The Traveller removes an object from their exosuit. It looks abstract, crimson, flesh-like, perfect...}
FTH_NPC_LANG_6	{Another Traveller, hm. Well, we should speak.
Have faith. Not all dreams are idle fancies. Not all fictions are untruths. Perhaps all of this is based in something real. Perhaps we did once exist, long ago...
Proof? Here, look at this...}
FTH_NPC_OPT_A_6	{Look at the object}
FTH_NPC_OPT_B_6	{Refuse to look}
FTH_NPC_RES_A_6	{I look at the object and am filled with a sense of hope. Everything will be alright. I know it. Nothing can hurt me.
All I have to do is believe and have faith... not in a deity, not in some universal tyrant. No...
It is this, right in front of me.}
FTH_NPC_RES_B_6	{I refuse to look at the object, turning away from the Traveller.
They claim that they understand, that perhaps I am not ready for their truth. They wish me well.}
FTH_NPC_DESC_7	{The Traveller shows me an image of a Gek. They watch me keenly, explaining that they were hired to find this individual by the Trade Federation itself.}
FTH_NPC_LANG_7	{Hold. I'm looking for a missing Gek. Perhaps you'd recognise this face?}
FTH_NPC_OPT_A_7	{Ask for more information}
FTH_NPC_OPT_B_7	{Suggest this is not a Gek}
FTH_NPC_OPT_C_7	{Say yes}
FTH_NPC_RES_A_7	{The Traveller claims they cannot comment. They seem disappointed that I know nothing, and wish me good luck with my journey.}
FTH_NPC_RES_B_7	{The Traveller is shocked, but their suspicion grows. I tell them the Gek in question is no Gek at all, but a dangerous Korvax imposter known as a 'SynthetiGek'.
They interrogate me and, when satisfied I am not involved, they give me compensation for my time.}
FTH_NPC_RES_C_7	{The Traveller is pleased. They ask where I saw the Gek. But when I transmit some coordinates from a few systems back, they grow angry. They say these coordinates are meaningless.
They interrogate me and, when finally satisfied that I know nothing, they give me a little compensation for my time.}
FTH_NPC_DESC_8	{The Traveller's appearance, their manner, the way they speak... all of them feel archaic, like nothing I have heard before.
They repeat their question, threatening to draw their Multi-Sword.}
FTH_NPC_LANG_8	{Who do you serve? Which Baron is master of this place?}
FTH_NPC_OPT_A_8	{Say you do not understand}
FTH_NPC_OPT_B_8	{Claim you are}
FTH_NPC_OPT_C_8	{Ask where they are from}
FTH_NPC_RES_A_8	{The Traveller grows increasingly agitated, claiming that it is a simple question. I explain that there is no single ruler.
They ask me to prepare for invasion by the Great King, to spread the word far and wide. They give me a boon for my service.}
FTH_NPC_RES_B_8	{The Traveller grows nervous immediately, their demeanour changing to one of begrudging respect. They claim they have a message from the Great King. I am warned to bend a knee or face destruction.
They give me a gift as a token of the riches that await me should I come to a just and wise decision.}
FTH_NPC_RES_C_8	{The Traveller draws their Multi-Sword, claiming that I must jest. They declare that their insignia and mandate are clear: they are the Sheriff of the Great King.
They claim my lands are forfeit, and that I will regret this disrespectful incident...}
FTH_NPC_DESC_9	{The Traveller looks down, their eyes full of pain.}
FTH_NPC_LANG_9	{We were born too late to make a difference. I wonder, sometimes. If there's any point in going on. If anything matters, if history will just sweep everything away.
I'm sorry. I'm in a strange mood... After all, these are the last days, are they not?}
FTH_NPC_OPT_A_9	{Encourage them to go on}
FTH_NPC_OPT_B_9	{Ask about the last days}
FTH_NPC_OPT_C_9	{Say you feel the same}
FTH_NPC_RES_A_9	{The Traveller tries to smile, but fails even that. I try to tell them that there is a whole universe out there, that there is value in living, even if life will end.
They thank me for trying to help. They give me one of their possessions, claiming that they will not need it anymore.}
FTH_NPC_RES_B_9	{Have you not felt it? The very fact that you and I are talking, even now, across the chasm of universes...
Things are breaking apart. Give it time, you'll see. Nothing lasts forever.}
FTH_NPC_RES_C_9	{I don't know whether to laugh or cry...
Here, take this. I suppose I won't be needing it anymore. Do what you like.}
FTH_NPC_DESC_10	{The Traveller does not say anything else. They just stare at me, occasionally seeming as if they are about to retch.}
FTH_NPC_LANG_10	{Do not -<STELLAR> kzzkkkt <>- trust the water.}
FTH_NPC_OPT_A_10	{Ask about the water}
FTH_NPC_OPT_B_10	{Ask if they are alright}
FTH_NPC_RES_A_10	{The water... Tell me - <STELLAR>kzzkkt<> - did you drink it?
Please, take this - <STELLAR>kzzkkkt<> - run... I just wanted to hear her voice one last time...}
FTH_NPC_RES_B_10	{No, no... not now, not - <STELLAR>kzzkkt<> - the grand bargain, I failed them...
All of them are dead now. I had to drink it. I had no choice.}
FTH_NPC_DESC_11	{The Traveller looks at me, imploring, hopeful...}
FTH_NPC_LANG_11	{You. I've seen you before, I'd swear it. Do you remember me?
You don't, do you? Perhaps you're not even the same as you once were. All of us, we're shifting, bleeding in and out of worlds...}
FTH_NPC_OPT_A_11	{Say you remember}
FTH_NPC_OPT_B_11	{Say you don't remember}
FTH_NPC_OPT_C_11	{Accuse them of lying}
FTH_NPC_RES_A_11	{Hm. I don't know. I don't know at all... You could just be trying to trick me. There are so many untrustworthy souls... Leave me. I need to think. I need to remember who I am...}
FTH_NPC_RES_B_11	{That's alright... sometimes we have different names. Sometimes different faces. The ATLAS, it endlessly reconfigures, distilling everything that has ever been.
Here, take this. Perhaps it might help you. You gave it to me, long ago.}
FTH_NPC_RES_C_11	{I can't lie. Nothing can, if everything exists, if everything is possible. Everything is true...
Doesn't that fill you with horror?}
FTH_NPC_DESC_12	{The Traveller seems ill or old, their words laboured, broken. What decay is like for this species, I do not know, but they try to speak even in spite of their infirmity.}
FTH_NPC_LANG_12	{I should have done it sooner. I was... I was afraid. I - how do I do it? How do I make this right?}
FTH_NPC_OPT_A_12	{Tell them to be honest}
FTH_NPC_OPT_B_12	{Ask what they mean}
FTH_NPC_OPT_C_12	{Say you do not know}
FTH_NPC_RES_A_12	{They say they should never have deserted me. That I did not deserve this life, that they know I was just trying to help.
They pass me something through the smog of worlds, and in that instant, I know this individual.
But the vision passes. The Traveller stands before me, as if nothing had happened.}
FTH_NPC_RES_B_12	{They say that they abandoned me many years ago. That they were not ready for what fate had forced upon them. They tell me they are proud of me...
They pass me something through the smog of worlds, and in that instant, I know this individual. I know them, as if from another life...
But the vision passes. The Traveller stands before me, as if nothing had happened.}
FTH_NPC_RES_C_12	{The Traveller cries out and says no more, They hold out their hand as if to touch my own, but then I see the object within their palm.
As I take it, in that instant, I know this individual. I know them, as if from another life...
But the vision passes. The Traveller stands before me, as if nothing had happened.}
FTH_NPC_DESC_13	{The Traveller shows me an album full of images, photographs taken from across the universe and displayed through a variety of filters.}
FTH_NPC_LANG_13	{I know I'm somewhere far away. But I thought, that's an opportunity to express myself, isn't it?
I could show others sights they've never seen before... that only I will ever see.
May I add you to my collection, I wonder?}
FTH_NPC_OPT_A_13	{Say yes}
FTH_NPC_OPT_B_13	{Say no}
FTH_NPC_RES_A_13	{Wonderful... if you will just hold still, I'll take the picture...
There. Done.
Thank you for this, my friend... I'll even give you something in return. These nanites were given to me by the Traveller of Iteration 27489216. I hope they aid you on your path. Happy Travelling!}
FTH_NPC_RES_B_13	{Hm. A pity, but I respect your choice... not everyone suits having their photograph taken.
Very well, I shall become the subject of my own art... I will photograph myself in space.}
FTH_NPC_DESC_14	{The Traveller stands vacant, unresponsive to my arrival but for the warning from their exosuit.
There appears to be nothing wrong with the Traveller, but for a strange crimson substance at their hip.}
FTH_NPC_LANG_14	{Warning: ATLAS containment suit breached. Warning...}
FTH_NPC_OPT_A_14	{Touch the substance}
FTH_NPC_OPT_B_14	{Offer medical assistance}
FTH_NPC_OPT_C_14	{Leave them}
FTH_NPC_RES_A_14	{The substance recedes at my touch. My own suit begins to issue a warning, but it is quickly silenced.
I find myself strangely light-headed, and in possession of new nanite clusters.}
FTH_NPC_RES_B_14	{I offer assistance but upon further scrutiny, I realise that the Traveller within the suit is already dead.
The suit continues to speak, aping what must have been their wearer's voice. It gives me units, trying to act as if nothing was wrong.}
FTH_NPC_RES_C_14	{I leave them alone, the suit's warning echoing as I depart...}
FTH_NPC_DESC_15	{The message repeats and repeats, unvarying, its bearer perhaps only a hologram.}
FTH_NPC_LANG_15	{You - you there! Have you ever felt alone? Under threat from forces beyond imagining? Are you comfortable with multiversal cohabitation?
If so, you'll love the Rentocniijik Expanse! Our capital, Drogradur NO425, is throneworld to our thriving community of interdimensional anomalies.
Please, consider moving today!}
FTH_NPC_OPT_A_15	{Suggest you will consider it}
FTH_NPC_OPT_B_15	{Poke the hologram}
FTH_NPC_OPT_C_15	{Ask for an incentive}
FTH_NPC_RES_A_15	{I suggest I will consider it. The friendly Traveller passes me a green badge and some units to assist with my departure.}
FTH_NPC_RES_B_15	{I poke the hologram. To my horror, I discover it is not a hologram at all. The Traveller shakes their head, saying they are not sure if there is room for me in their organisation.}
FTH_NPC_RES_C_15	{The friendly Traveller nods, agreeing that the distance is vast. It gives me a warp cell to assist with my departure.}
FTH_NPC_LANG_16	{I need - <STELLAR>kzkzkkt<> - plutonium... please... stranded in the - <STELLAR>kzzkzkt<> -
All chance of rescue lost - <STELLAR>kzzkzkt<> - Traveller, you are my only hope...}
FTH_NPC_OPT_A_16	{Give plutonium substitute}
FTH_NPC_OPT_B_16	{Offer units}
FTH_NPC_OPT_C_16	{Say you cannot help}
FTH_NPC_RES_A_16	{I have no plutonium, but the Traveller seems content to receive condensed carbon.
Grateful for my assistance in fuelling their ship, they give me nanites in return. I may have saved their life.}
FTH_NPC_RES_B_16	{I offer units. The Traveller gives a faint smile in return. They give me a small gift in acknowledgement of my help.
Perhaps someone will arrive with the stock they need. Perhaps these units will assist them in a purchase. Perhaps that will be too late...}
FTH_NPC_RES_C_16	{I say that I cannot help. The Traveller claims that they understand. But as I leave them, it seems certain that without help, they will surely die.}
FTH_NPC_DESC_17	{The Traveller offers me a darkened manuscript, the material flesh like and almost translucent...}
FTH_NPC_LANG_17	{The creature, it... it spoke to me. It saw me, even in the space between worlds.
And do you know what it did? It gave me a gift, a single piece of paper. A mathematical proof.}
FTH_NPC_OPT_A_17	{Read}
FTH_NPC_OPT_B_17	{Refuse to read}
FTH_NPC_OPT_C_17	{Destroy the page}
FTH_NPC_RES_A_17	{I read the manuscript. It appears to show a mathematical proof that the concept of 'goodness' does not exist.
As I read, the Traveller stares at me. They ask how we can possibly go on, knowing that this is true. I do not know.
We exchange gifts and I move on, troubled by what I have read.}
FTH_NPC_RES_B_17	{I refuse to read the manuscript. I reassure the Traveller, claiming that whatever this page says, it need not startle them so much as it does.
They just stare at me. Eventually they give me their units, telling me that they are ashamed.}
FTH_NPC_RES_C_17	{I destroy the page without reading it. The Traveller stares into the flame as it burns.
They tell me that no-one else should ever have to learn what we have learned.}
FTH_NPC_LANG_18	{Don't you understand it? Why we cannot meet, why we find only hollow echoes or corpses?
There is only one of us for each iteration - a single Traveller sent out to explore its vast creation.
That we are speaking at all, that the boundaries have crumbled as much as they have - it should fill you with terror, not with hope.}
FTH_NPC_OPT_A_18	{Suggest this was meant to happen}
FTH_NPC_OPT_B_18	{Ask about the boundaries}
FTH_NPC_OPT_C_18	{Ask how they know this}
FTH_NPC_RES_A_18	{I suggest that this was meant to happen. Even if the Travellers have been alone so far, perhaps we were always meant to find each other. Perhaps this breakdown is for the best.
The Traveller hopes that I am right. They give me a gift for the dark times ahead.}
FTH_NPC_RES_B_18	{The boundaries are all that separate concept from concept, possible world from possible world, the Sentinels ever policing their anomalies and breaches...
If the boundaries were to fall, everything would descend into everything, an endless bonfire of causation, burning in the abyss.
Take this. It will do no good, yet you will need it.}
FTH_NPC_RES_C_18	{The Traveller tells me that they sought something they call the Great Intelligence, its dark freighter. It told them of our fate, the Traveller's dilemma, our future...
They give me a gift for the dark times ahead, wishing me luck.}
FTH_NPC_LANG_19	{You... I saw you there, speaking to myself...
I've been having such terrible dreams. I should not have sought the Atlas... I should not have listened to their voices. I'm going to kill again.
And when I do, I'll find you, blood caked across my exosuit, flesh within my teeth...
I can't stop it. I see this future as if it has already happened... as it will happen. Nothing can prevent it. What can I do? How can I live with this knowledge?}
FTH_NPC_OPT_A_19	{Suggest the vision is false}
FTH_NPC_OPT_B_19	{Propose they prevent it}
FTH_NPC_OPT_C_19	{Say the future is not their fault}
FTH_NPC_RES_A_19	{You are kind for saying so, but you are wrong.
Take this. I will not be needing it any longer. Not when I am awake.}
FTH_NPC_RES_B_19	{How? Kill myself? I would just return... something would bring me back. This cannot be prevented.
Take this. I will not be needing it any longer. Not when I am awake.}
FTH_NPC_RES_C_19	{It is. I will do what I will do, because I am myself.
You should leave. I am experiencing such thoughts... such terrors...}
FTH_NPC_DESC_20	{I see a vision of myself, older, undaunted, travelling beneath the star of an alien world. But I am not alone. There are other Travellers with me. More than just apparitions, more than just visitors.
One day we will travel together, side by side. There will be no sky we cannot claim, no challenge which we cannot overcome. Our universe awaits.
The vision ends. The Traveller asks me how I feel.}
FTH_NPC_LANG_20	{Hm. It's really you, isn't it? I had to see it for myself. The dawn of the Travellers. The last days of the universe.

FTH_REQUEST_LANG_18	{I just want to make units, get a better ship, share a few photographs. I don't understand why we can't just have a relaxed time. It's what travelling is supposed to be.}
FTH_REQUEST_LANG_19	{Not all Travellers are quite so curious. Some do not even stop to ask my name. They do not care about their brethren... no, not one bit...}

The pilot's log is filled only with a deep and terrible laughter, a warning of some secret truth behind the universe's operation. It begs me to realise where I am. It begs me to wake up.
